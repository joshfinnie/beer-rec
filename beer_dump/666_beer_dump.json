Big Muddy Brewing in Murphysboro, Illinois is much like many of these new \u201cmicrobreweries\u201d all over the country, reinvigorating an industry and continuing a heritage that has skipped several generations.\r\nUntil 1940, Murphysboro was the home of a thriving brewery and until prohibition; it was one of the cornerstones of the town\u2019s industry. In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery\u2019s demise.\r\nBig Muddy Brewing\u2019s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago\u2019s Rosati\u2019s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries.\r\nIt was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer.\r\nStuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously.\r\nStuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years.\r\nThe first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg\u2019s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good \u201ccraft beer transition brew\u201d for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC).\r\nKinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s second selection, \u201cSaluki Dunkel Dog\u201d, a dark, amber/dunkel style beer.\r\nThe third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s lineup is an ale called \u201cBig Muddy Pale Ale\u201d, and future varieties include \u201cLogan\u2019s Lager\u201d.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm\r\n`", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Murphysboro", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "id": "QkdgSV", "streetAddress": "1430 North 7th Street", "postalCode": "62966", "website": "http://www.bigmuddybrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2009", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(618) 684-8833", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 37.7823381, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -89.3321145, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-04-30 14:46:55", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-icon.png"}, "id": "oBe8dQ", "name": "Big Muddy Brewing Co"}], "name": "Winter Ale", "createDate": "2013-11-01 13:05:24", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/BnbFhb/upload_0iFFzu-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/BnbFhb/upload_0iFFzu-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/BnbFhb/upload_0iFFzu-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and/or spices used may not always be identifiable.

Established as a mining settlement in the mid 1800's and continuing as a ranching community through the 1900's, Kernville remains a town of adventure, offering a wide variety of outdoor activities.  On any given day, the outdoor enthusiast enjoys activities ranging from the excitement of whitewater rafting, kayaking, downhill skiing, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, horseback riding, attending rodeos, windsurfing, water-skiing, mountain biking and climbing.  If a more relaxing day is preferred, people can enjoy fishing, hiking, camping, sailing, antiquing, and bird watching or simply kicking back and taking in the spectacular views of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:59", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "sIBGId", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Kernville", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:59", "streetAddress": "13415 Sierra Highway", "postalCode": "93238", "website": "http://www.kernriverbrewingcompany.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2006", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "760-376-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.757512, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -118.419213, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-03-21 19:06:10", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/E1zSFp/upload_m8yLwX-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/E1zSFp/upload_m8yLwX-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/E1zSFp/upload_m8yLwX-icon.png"}, "id": "E1zSFp", "name": "Kern River Brewing Company"}], "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-11-20 13:02:24", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/m4QA0c/upload_6ZTatu-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/m4QA0c/upload_6ZTatu-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/m4QA0c/upload_6ZTatu-icon.png"}, "updateDate": "2012-11-20 13:02:25", "id": "m4QA0c", "name": "Winter Ale"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "This rich malty brown ale is flavored with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and a kiss of almond!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:44:31", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.squareonebrewery.com/", "established": "2006", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "The Square One Brewery & Distillery began operations as a brewery /restaurant in February of 2006.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character. Competition organizers may choose to distinguish these types of old ale from modern versions.)", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "30", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "65", "abvMin": "6", "fgMin": "1.014", "fgMax": "1.03", "abvMax": "9", "id": 13, "srmMin": "12", "name": "Old Ale"}, "name": "Winter Ale (Old Port Ale)", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "updateDate": "2012-09-08 22:28:40", "abv": "7.3", "styleId": 13, "availableId": 4, "id": "lLp3il", "glasswareId": 5}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.empyreanbrewingco.com/", "established": "1990", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "It began with a dream that we could brew full-flavored beer in the great state of Nebraska.
