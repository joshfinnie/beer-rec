In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system.

This undeniable endurance is a testament of why the Stevens Point Brewery, in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, is the 5th oldest continuously operating brewery remaining in the United States. Today, the Stevens Point Brewery is proud to be Wisconsin-owned and independently operated.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:09", "mailingListUrl": "http://visitor.constantcontact.com/manage/optin/ea?v=001QOqrPM3hRDN-5KgIao1mCQ==", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "54skNQ", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Stevens Point", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:09", "streetAddress": "2617 Water Street", "postalCode": "54481", "website": "http://www.pointbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1857", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "715-344-9310", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.5104, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -89.5734, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-02-24 15:18:51", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/djGgca/upload_h8EkpA-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/djGgca/upload_h8EkpA-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/djGgca/upload_h8EkpA-icon.png"}, "id": "djGgca", "name": "Stevens Point Brewery"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.033", "description": "Ordinary bitter is gold to copper colored with medium bitterness, light to medium body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness.
