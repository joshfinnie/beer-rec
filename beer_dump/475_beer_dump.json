From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "DrFlD0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Carlsbad", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "571 Carlsbad Village Dr.", "postalCode": "92008", "website": "http://www.pizzaport.com/locations/carlsbad/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1997", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "760-720-7007", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Carlsbad", "latitude": 33.1596505, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.3478111, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Sun - Thur - 11am - 10pm\r\nFri - Sat. - 11am - Midnight", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Solana Beach", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "id": "qAyZMR", "streetAddress": "135 N.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

It fits well in wallets and tastes good under cheese. We like to think we\u2019ve got some good dough. We make pizza crust, we make sandwich bread, and we make finely crafted dog sweaters. Alright, we don\u2019t make the last one, but we COULD if we wanted to. We take pride in the freshness of our dough and veggies. Our dough was made today. It wasn\u2019t made in Topeka, frozen, shipped here, and warmed up. Ask who made it and he or she is probably in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhy no Straws? We know you didn\u2019t get one. You\u2019ll use them for about seven minutes and then we have to throw them away. It\u2019s nothing personal. If you absolutely need one we\u2019re happy to oblige, but we\u2019re trying to reduce our non-recyclables, keep our landfills at a minimum, and keep plastic out of our oceans. Find a kid and ask them about plastic. Plastic pollutes our oceans and air, so we serve our beverages in glass. If you want to bring a kid cup from home, we\u2019ll fill it up!\r\n\r\nWhat, no Coasters? You\u2019d be amazed at how many coasters we pick up off the floor. If our tables were Peruvian mahogany, inlaid with reclaimed oak from an historic church in New Brunswick, we\u2019d say \u201check yeah, give that pizza patron a coaster!\u201d Let\u2019s conserve together.\r\n\r\nHopefully you\u2019re now thinking, \u201cWow Henrietta, these are some globally concerned restaurateurs.\u201d But, then again, maybe you\u2019re wondering about the lack of ice in the sodas? Are we trying to conserve ice bergs? Nope. We don\u2019t even know any icebergs. Our soda\u2019s are handmade with the finest extracts available, fantastic water and cane sugar. They\u2019re served at cellar temps just like our beers, so you get a full flavored beverage that doesn\u2019t need to be watered down. There\u2019s a saying in Colorado, Whiskey\u2019s for drinking, water\u2019s for fighting. (We also have Whiskey, no fighting). If you want ice, just ask. We\u2019ll not think less of you. Becoming a soda pop connoisseur takes time.\r\n\r\nFrom all of us at Moonlight Pizza: Kick back, order another beer, enjoy the sunset, and don\u2019t forget your leftovers!
