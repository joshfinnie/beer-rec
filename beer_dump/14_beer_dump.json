Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

The brewery is named for the famed Clipper ship - first developed and built in the home port of Baltimore. While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste.

It is located in the city of Drammen, approximately 25 miles south of our capital, Oslo. You will spot it at the banks of the Drammen River at the very same place as it has been since 1834. The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.aass.no", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Drammen", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "countryIsoCode": "NO", "longitude": 10.190885, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "47-32-26-60-00", "streetAddress": "Ole Steensgt. 10 Postboks 1530", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Norway", "name": "NORWAY", "isoThree": "NOR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 578, "isoCode": "NO"}, "latitude": 59.731819, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "gaVq6l", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "updateDate": "2012-12-16 14:42:39", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TGtEbk/upload_fgq5cE-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TGtEbk/upload_fgq5cE-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TGtEbk/upload_fgq5cE-icon.png"}, "id": "TGtEbk", "name": "Aass Brewery"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 7, "name": "European-germanic Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California.
