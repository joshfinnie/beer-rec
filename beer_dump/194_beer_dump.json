Only those patrons 19 or older may participate in the tasting component of the tour.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-03-30 01:13:50", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "v4PaPH", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Nanaimo", "createDate": "2012-03-30 01:15:25", "streetAddress": "5775 Turner Road", "postalCode": "V9T 6L8", "website": "http://www.longwoodbrewpub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "CA", "phone": "250-729-8225", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewpub & Brewery", "latitude": 49.225503, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "British Columbia", "longitude": -124.035479, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Canada", "name": "CANADA", "isoThree": "CAN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 124, "isoCode": "CA"}}], "updateDate": "2012-03-30 01:28:11", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jtBUsv/upload_BhCmx8-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jtBUsv/upload_BhCmx8-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jtBUsv/upload_BhCmx8-icon.png"}, "id": "jtBUsv", "name": "Longwood Brewpub"}], "updateDate": "2012-03-30 01:17:27", "abv": "5.5", "id": "QyhJP4", "name": "Dunkelwiezenbrau"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:08", "breweries": [{"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Watertown", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -88.7229459, "isClosed": "Y", "phone": "920-206-9505", "streetAddress": "201 East Main Street", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "53094", "latitude": 43.193936, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "Ekq5lL", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "name": "Bellows Brew Crew", "updateDate": "2012-03-21 19:06:03", "id": "Q7zhMz", "description": "Bellows moved from Waunakee to Watertown in December 2001.
