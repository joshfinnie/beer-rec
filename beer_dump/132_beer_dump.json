Through the years the company has grown from a three person operation to a staff of almost 50, from about 4,000 to 35,000 square feet, and from a capacity to brew 2,000 barrels annually to almost 40,000. Those of you who saw the old brewery may remember the retrofitted dairy equipment we used. We held on to two of those tanks in our move to the East Asheville location. Alongside them, we have new fermentation and brite beer tanks to go with our 50-barrel brew house. Our pilot brew house is a brewer's playground for developing new seasonal beers, high gravity brews, and whatever else the brewers dream up. Highland currently supplies both Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "HeStKS", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Potosi", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "streetAddress": "209 South Main Street", "postalCode": "53820", "extendedAddress": "Box 177", "website": "http://www.potosibrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1852", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "608-763-4002", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.6716654, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -90.7271709, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-01-08 21:22:00", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-icon.png"}, "id": "Q4eTmd", "name": "Potosi Brewing Company"}], "description": "Potosi Cave ale is brewed as a hybrid of three English beer styles.
