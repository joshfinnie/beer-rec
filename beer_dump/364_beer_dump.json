Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "srmMax": "100", "ibuMax": "100", "abvMin": "2.5", "fgMin": "1.006", "fgMax": "1.03", "abvMax": "25", "id": 125, "srmMin": "1", "name": "Specialty Beer"}, "updateDate": "2012-08-19 13:05:10", "styleId": 125, "id": "IjTfWl", "name": "Lindhorster Roggen"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-08-12 12:23:15", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.brauerei-eckart.de/", "established": "2006", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Spezialit\u00e4tenbrauerei Eckart", "createDate": "2012-08-07 10:20:23", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "DE", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Colbitz", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "createDate": "2012-08-16 15:12:05", "longitude": 11.595782, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 52.299248, "streetAddress": "Am Diek 12", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Germany", "name": "GERMANY", "isoThree": "DEU", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 276, "isoCode": "DE"}, "postalCode": "39326", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "SmLlGS", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-08-16 15:11:37", "id": "DWG9s4", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.08", "description": "Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.
