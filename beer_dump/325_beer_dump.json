Established in 2003, its beer has gone on to be the most popular British bottled beer sold in Canada, and second most popular in Sweden. It was part of the nominated drinks list for the G8 Summit 2005 at Gleneagles Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe business is, since 2008, family owned following a management buy-out from its original part-owners, William Grant and Sons.\r\n\r\nTheir Innis & Gunn Original beer is brewed in Dunbar, East Lothian before being matured in American white oak Bourbon barrels for 30 days and is then a further 47 days in a marrying tun, and so it is matured for 77 days in total. It is 6.6% alcohol by volume. At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught.\r\n\r\nAccording to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.\r\n\r\nA \"blonde\" version of Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum barrels was produced.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-08-03 00:34:11", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.innisandgunn.com/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 55.951976, "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Edinburgh", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "longitude": -3.211095, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "+44 (0) 131 337 4420", "streetAddress": "6 Randolph Crescent", "createDate": "2012-08-03 12:39:07", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}, "postalCode": "EH3 7TH", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "0HAazs", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-08-03 12:40:12", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-icon.png"}, "id": "jC0TAa", "name": "Innis & Gunn"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel.

Fortunately for beer lovers in North Texas, Fritz not only fell in love with Fort Worth, but also fell in love with his future wife here. And in another fortuitous twist for all of us, Fritz\u2019s wife, Erin, gave him the thumbs up when he announced that he would like to carry on the Rahr family tradition of brewing.\r\n\r\nFritz and Erin founded Rahr & Sons Brewing Co. in the fall of 2004. In five years, the brewery has more than doubled its brewing capacity - from 2,000 barrels per year to over 5,000 barrels per year and has won fifteen nationally-recognized awards, including a Bronze Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup for Bucking Bock and 2009 National Grand Champion from the United States Beer Tasting Championships for Iron Thistle.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Wed:5:00 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nSat:1:00 pm - 3:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Fort Worth", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "id": "X6U0o8", "streetAddress": "701 Galveston Avenue", "postalCode": "76104", "website": "http://www.rahrbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2004", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "817-810-9266", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 32.7368128, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Texas", "longitude": -97.3275585, "updateDate": "2014-10-29 16:04:43", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-31 11:14:52", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_q2wS2m-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_q2wS2m-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_q2wS2m-icon.png"}, "id": "WCBdy2", "name": "Rahr & Sons Brewing Company"}], "foodPairings": "Food Pairings: According to a well-respected expert, Iron Thistle pairs really well with grilled or steamed vegetables because \u201cthey won\u2019t have to scream to be heard.\u201d Since we find screaming vegetables unappetizing, we think this is a perfect pairing.\r\n\r\nCheese Pairings: Brie, Aged Gouda", "servingTemperature": "cool", "updateDate": "2014-05-02 12:06:26", "ibu": "25"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.legacybrewingco.com", "established": "2012", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Legacy Brewing Company", "createDate": "2014-03-16 21:36:58", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Sun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Oceanside", "createDate": "2014-03-16 21:37:30", "id": "HIzVEo", "streetAddress": "363 Airport Road", "postalCode": "92058", "website": "http://www.legacybrewingco.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2012", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(760) 705-3221", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 33.2153901, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.3507698, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-03-16 21:37:58", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QXkarn/upload_38Zrp8-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QXkarn/upload_38Zrp8-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QXkarn/upload_38Zrp8-icon.png"}, "id": "QXkarn", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "name": "Iron Wharf Lager", "createDate": "2014-09-10 13:37:28", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/luckmb/upload_DVH6Iw-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/luckmb/upload_DVH6Iw-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/luckmb/upload_DVH6Iw-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 7, "name": "European-germanic Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness.
