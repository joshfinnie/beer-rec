It\u2019s not just because of the award-winning fine ales and great food served up by the Rubicon. Within the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts. It\u2019s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis pub is part of the community, and I don\u2019t just mean geographically,\u201d said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation. I really feel like we\u2019re connected with the people and that they can trust that they\u2019ll feel at home here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrewmaster Scott Cramlet has felt so at home that he\u2019s stayed more than two decades. In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we\u2019re very happy with things right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I\u2019m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I\u2019ve been at the Rubicon, and I hear people say, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s impressive.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown\u2019s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry \u2013 first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur \u2013 Phillips kept in close contact with Brown.
