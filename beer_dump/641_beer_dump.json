During the first seven years of brewing our focus was always on quality as we developed seven traditional beer styles and multiple seasonal and specialty beers.  With several awards to our name and a growing demand for our beer, we took a huge leap and expanded into a brand new 12,000 square foot 30 barrel production facility in the south downtown area of Grand Junction near the Colorado River.  This new restaurant that also houses our production facility is known as Edgewater Brewery.\r\n\r\nThroughout our growth we have invested our time, energy, and resources reflecting our passion and devotion to maintain the highest standard quality.  We currently bottle three of our mainstays in additional to seasonal selections.  Plus limited release bomber bottles of a select variety.
