The choices available to the local beer nerdery are staggering and ever expanding. The neighborhood corner stores continue to add microbrews to their stock and it seems that a dynamite draft selection is essential to any new bar that opens. Restaurants regularly hold beer dinners featuring multi-course food and beer pairings and for seven days in the spring, during DC Beer Week, the number of beer-themed events can make the head spin. At a handful of downtown brewpubs the beer enthusiast can sample a variety of house made brews.
