Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "9", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "17", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "2.8", "fgMin": "1.006", "fgMax": "1.012", "abvMax": "3.5", "id": 7, "srmMin": "8", "name": "Scottish-Style Light Ale"}, "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "updateDate": "2012-03-22 13:05:37", "abv": "9", "styleId": 7, "id": "EICTkH", "glasswareId": 5}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.sierranevada.com/", "established": "1980", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "The Sierra Nevada Brewing Company was established in 1980 by homebrewers Ken Grossman and Paul Camusi.
