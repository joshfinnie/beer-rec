These guys (we\u2019ll call them Chris and Josh for lack of anonymity\u2019s sake) got better at brewing over the years, even as they moved apart.\r\n\r\nChris went down a corporate marketing path; Josh seemed to prefer engineering and operations; both still enjoyed beer and, with lots of practice, the homebrew got better and better. When Y2K sputtered out before it even came to life, the two had their first discussion about opening a brewery. More life happened. More of the guys\u2019 improving craft beers were served at more home parties. When they got together again more recently, the topic resurfaced, but this time it wouldn\u2019t go away. And gradually a brewery was born.\r\n\r\n20 years since the start of their homebrew hobbies, Odyssey Beerwerks was formed to do the impossible: take an enjoyable hobby of creating fine craft beers and make it into a dreary job, with the benefit of bringing new and exciting hand crafted beers onto our vibrant planet.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-08-05 17:24:36", "mailingListUrl": "https://www.facebook.com/OdysseyBeerwerks/app_100265896690345", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "M-Th 3-9\r\nF-Sa 2-10\r\nSu Noon-7", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Arvada", "createDate": "2013-08-06 20:42:31", "id": "I4hZZy", "streetAddress": "5535 W 56th Ave,", "postalCode": "80002", "extendedAddress": "Suite 107", "website": "http://www.odysseybeerwerks.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2011", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(303) 421-0772", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.8007911, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Colorado", "longitude": -105.0589359, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-09-10 20:23:19", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zMORP4/upload_73PUUD-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zMORP4/upload_73PUUD-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zMORP4/upload_73PUUD-icon.png"}, "id": "zMORP4", "name": "Odyssey Beerwerks"}], "srm": {"hex": "FFBF42", "id": 4, "name": "4"}, "servingTemperature": "cold", "updateDate": "2014-09-10 21:18:41", "ibu": "12"}], "numberOfPages": 683}
