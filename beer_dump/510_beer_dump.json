We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nAngel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became \u0003a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the \u0003facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great \u0003city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we\u2019re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival.

Art co-founded one of the state's first microbreweries, Portland Brewing, as well as the Oregon Brewers Festival, which today is one of the world's preeminent craft beer festivals. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewmaster Ron Gansberg got his start in the Northwest wine industry. He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market.

In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.\r\n\r\nOwners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.struisebrouwers.be/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Woesten", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "West-Vlaanderen", "countryIsoCode": "BE", "longitude": 2.7831, "country": {"displayName": "Belgium", "name": "BELGIUM", "isoThree": "BEL", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 56, "isoCode": "BE"}, "isClosed": "N", "streetAddress": "Woesten", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2001", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "latitude": 50.900311, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "qcAp7N", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-10-30 11:30:48", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_rK0nnu-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_rK0nnu-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_rK0nnu-icon.png"}, "id": "bjwFtZ", "name": "De Struise"}], "name": "Rio Reserva", "createDate": "2012-11-11 17:01:42", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/cOwbNP/upload_HTNl7T-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/cOwbNP/upload_HTNl7T-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/cOwbNP/upload_HTNl7T-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "description": "A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood.
