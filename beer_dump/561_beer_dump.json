Robbie owned a farm in scenic Maiden Rock, WI just above the confluence of the Rush River and Lake Pepin. After converting a pole barn into a fully functioning brewery, the trio produced a limited quantity of draft-only beers while steadily building a reputation  for brewing high quality ales. After two and a half years of growth, it became evident that bottled beer was the next move to be made. Luckily, the town of River Falls, WI came to the table with an offer to build a custom building for a brand new brewery. In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters. The new Rush River brewery was now poised to increase production and distributorship. We now have ten distributors in two states and produce nine brands including seasonals. Our small size still allows us to experiment with new styles, while the larger capacity for brewing and storage keep our regular brands flowing out the door.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "River Falls", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -92.6377675, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "1-715-426-2054", "streetAddress": "990 Antler Court", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "54022", "latitude": 44.8902357, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "hHD54O", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-05-08 12:39:21", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wpQqy4/upload_seaXqD-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wpQqy4/upload_seaXqD-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wpQqy4/upload_seaXqD-icon.png"}, "id": "wpQqy4", "name": "Rush River Brewing"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.036", "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Brewed in the traditional \"small beer\" style made from the second runnings of our massive Imperial Stout Pugachev's Cobra. Small beers are a practice that dates back hundreds of years to monastic brewing traditions. In those days, brewers would make a large strong beer for the King or Abbot and then smaller beers for the regular citizens or monks. Our Small Stout is an American-style dry stout. Roast barley character blends with hints of chocolate and espresso. The beer finishes crisp and dry accentuated by a nice hop character. At 4.8% ABV, this is a great session beer for your St. Patty's Day celebration.\r\n\r\nWe like to serve our Small Stout \"Nitro\" style. This involves using a blend of Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide gas and pouring the beer through a specially designed \"Stout Tap.\" We also use Nitrogen gas to condition the beer. Beer served in this way presents a beautiful cascading bubble effect and a dense, white head as it is poured. This is due to the Nitrogen being less soluble in liquid and coming out of solution quickly. The finished result creates a creamy texture and a velvety mouthfeel that we think takes this beer to the next level.", "name": "Small Stout", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 8, "name": "Tulip"}, "createDate": "2013-05-09 02:47:33", "servingTemperatureDisplay": "Cool - (8-12C/45-54F)", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.05", "description": "Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

It\u2019s like the ecru-coloured top of a beer pie before it gives up and grips the glass. You can see the Victory malt\u2019s signature in the amber lights in what is primarily a deep golden beer. And, yes, don\u2019t be fooled --there\u2019s malt going on here, too, as you\u2019ll see in the firey body of this ale that makes Smashbomb Atomic look like it radiates its own energy. \r\n\r\nWith the first taste, Smashbomb\u2019s 70 IBUs are pronounced. This brew is a little bitter, but bitter like a grapefruit with three tablespoons of sugar on top. It\u2019s also incredibly drinkable. The oddity that\u2019ll keep you tipping the glass is that as this citrus peel front subsides, you actually gleen the sweet flavours of the Victory and Crystal malts. Then, as the bread-puddin\u2019 bicuity sweetness of the malts are chased by the dry, tropical flavour of Citra and the fruit punch bouquet is all in your face with each sip, it\u2019s all is so damn intriguing, you\u2019ll be driven to keep on sampling...and sampling.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-10-15 15:38:03", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LLQneg/upload_Gt7iyS-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LLQneg/upload_Gt7iyS-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LLQneg/upload_Gt7iyS-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale.
