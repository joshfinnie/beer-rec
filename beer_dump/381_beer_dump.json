Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale.

As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market.

Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers.

If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "5", "categoryId": 11, "srmMax": "50", "ibuMax": "70", "abvMin": "2.5", "fgMin": "1.006", "fgMax": "1.03", "abvMax": "12", "id": 119, "srmMin": "5", "name": "Fruit Beer"}, "updateDate": "2013-09-29 13:04:57", "abv": "5.8", "styleId": 119, "availableId": 6, "id": "eRqVDp", "name": "Manmosa"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "Y", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.brasseriedelasenne.be/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Brasserie de la Senne", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "BE", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Sint-Pieters-Leeuw", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Vlaams Brabant", "longitude": 4.2437811, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "32-0497-/-93.23.75", "streetAddress": "Victor Nonnemansstraat 40a", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Belgium", "name": "BELGIUM", "isoThree": "BEL", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 56, "isoCode": "BE"}, "latitude": 50.785247, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "bjwFtZ", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "updateDate": "2014-05-06 15:45:05", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/lzCMme/upload_jy4XJL-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/lzCMme/upload_jy4XJL-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/lzCMme/upload_jy4XJL-icon.png"}, "id": "lzCMme", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "name": "Manneken-Penn", "createDate": "2013-05-04 14:06:12", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/6I02Jx/upload_P9kv0q-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/6I02Jx/upload_P9kv0q-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/6I02Jx/upload_P9kv0q-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "description": "These beers must portray the unique characters imparted by yeasts typically used in fruity and big Belgian-Style ales - These beers are not traditional Belgian styles which are already defined.
