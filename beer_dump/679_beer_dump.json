Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River.

It\u2019s in the Wagner kitchen where Eric first combined his passion and talent for gourmet cooking with over 20 years of engineering expertise, specifically in treating water. Who knew that brewing delicious beer was so similar to the science of treating water? The process of releasing enzymes to break down starches into sugar and fermenting the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide is second nature to a water engineer, while balancing delicious flavor is what a gourmet cook strives for. Hence the \u201cblueprint\u201d for great beer was born! Eric\u2019s unique combination of talents led the way for the one-of-a-kind, handcrafted beer, each as original as a fingerprint.\r\n\r\nBetter than a recipe, a brewing \u201cblueprint\u201d combines science and great culinary skill to create a Br\u00fceprint.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s with this vision that we bring Apex its first handcrafted Brewery\u2014Br\u00fceprint Brewing Company. The Wagner family, that is Br\u00fceprint, is dedicated to traditional social interaction while sampling delicious beer.
