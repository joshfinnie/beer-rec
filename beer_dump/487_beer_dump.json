Big Muddy Brewing in Murphysboro, Illinois is much like many of these new \u201cmicrobreweries\u201d all over the country, reinvigorating an industry and continuing a heritage that has skipped several generations.\r\nUntil 1940, Murphysboro was the home of a thriving brewery and until prohibition; it was one of the cornerstones of the town\u2019s industry. In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery\u2019s demise.\r\nBig Muddy Brewing\u2019s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago\u2019s Rosati\u2019s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries.\r\nIt was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer.\r\nStuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously.\r\nStuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years.\r\nThe first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg\u2019s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good \u201ccraft beer transition brew\u201d for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC).\r\nKinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s second selection, \u201cSaluki Dunkel Dog\u201d, a dark, amber/dunkel style beer.\r\nThe third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s lineup is an ale called \u201cBig Muddy Pale Ale\u201d, and future varieties include \u201cLogan\u2019s Lager\u201d.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm\r\n`", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Murphysboro", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "id": "QkdgSV", "streetAddress": "1430 North 7th Street", "postalCode": "62966", "website": "http://www.bigmuddybrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2009", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(618) 684-8833", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 37.7823381, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -89.3321145, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-04-30 14:46:55", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-icon.png"}, "id": "oBe8dQ", "name": "Big Muddy Brewing Co"}], "name": "Pumpkin Smasher", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-11-01 13:05:07", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ZTsRYA/upload_897Jsm-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ZTsRYA/upload_897Jsm-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ZTsRYA/upload_897Jsm-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "Pumpkin beers are any beers using pumpkins (Cucurbito pepo) as an adjunct in either mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, qualities.
