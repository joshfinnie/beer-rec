In 2011 Walt and Luke\u2019s lifelong friend Ryan Guthy and his parents Rick and Denise all sat down at their house in the mountains of Western North Carolina to taste some of Luke and Walt\u2019s creations while looking over the plans for what would be Wicked Weed Brewing.  After being thoroughly impressed with the full flavor and vision of the project, the Guthys joined the Dickinsons and the team was assembled.  Over the next months Wicked Weed Brewing found a home at 91 Biltmore avenue, a building that seemed destined to be a brewery.\r\nWith the creativity of Luke, vision of Walt, dedication of Ryan, exquisite taste of Denise and wisdom of Rick a truly unique brewery was born.  So from the humble beginning of a basement, the dream of Wicked Weed Brewing has come to life. Our beer is bold, full of excitement and flavor.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties).

While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste.
