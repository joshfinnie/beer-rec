Ever since the beginnings of the American Beer Renaissance, I have wanted to brew my own great tasting beer and make it available to the beer drinking public and help people learn about and appreciate beer. Coming from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, beer brewing is in my veins.\r\n\r\nTwelve years ago my wonderful wife bought me the \"everything but the kitchen sink\" homebrew kit and it all started. After a few extract brew sessions, I built a 15 gallon brew sculpture and graduated to all-grain brewing, and things really got serious. Now after over 200 brews, BCB is in business!\r\n\r\nThe brewery is small, we call it a Nano-Brewery, we are hidden in the middle of 38 acres of woods in the heart of North Carolina. Most everything is recycled or made in-house. The Brew-House is an old 20' steel cargo container, the Beer-Garden brew patio is recycled flagstone and granite, nestled under spreading oaks and pines, our cooling water is stored rain water from a cistern, the chickens just love the spent mash. All the ingredients are as fresh as possible, some are even home grown. American malts, hops, and yeast are the mainstay of our beers. The water is from our 450' well and is just as pure and clean as can be. Our small batch brewing lets us assure you that each keg or bottle of beer will be as fresh and wonderful as though we were brewing it for ourselves to drink.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-03-21 12:55:26", "locations": [{"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "EfLTd6", "locationTypeDisplay": "Nano Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bear Creek", "createDate": "2014-03-21 12:56:05", "streetAddress": "10538 NC 902 Hwy", "postalCode": "27207", "website": "http://www.bearcreekbrews.com/", "statusDisplay": "Deleted", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(919) 200-3930", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.6518126, "locationType": "nano", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -79.3329623, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "qz4HmX", "locationTypeDisplay": "Nano Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bear Creek", "createDate": "2014-03-21 12:56:06", "streetAddress": "10538 NC 902 Hwy", "postalCode": "27207", "website": "http://www.bearcreekbrews.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(919) 200-3930", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.6518126, "locationType": "nano", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -79.3329623, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "updateDate": "2014-03-21 12:55:26", "id": "9GewxD", "name": "Bear Creek Brews"}], "description": "Our newest beer to fill our six-pack is Red\u2014an Irish Style Ale.\r\n\r\nRed is a traditionally styled Irish Ale with a hefty helping of malt, a little taste of roasted barley and some wonderful red color from the crystal malt, classically hopped with Fuggles and Kent Goldings.\r\n\r\nYou will really enjoy this winter warmer any time of the year.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-03-21 12:58:56", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/8ikyKx/upload_rI41sV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/8ikyKx/upload_rI41sV-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/8ikyKx/upload_rI41sV-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 2, "name": "Irish Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.
