We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Tasting Room & Store Hours\r\nMonday-Friday, 11:00-7:00\r\nSaturday-Sunday, 10:00-5:00", "locationTypeDisplay": "Tasting Room", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "id": "PckBjw", "streetAddress": "5401 Linda Vista Road", "postalCode": "92110", "extendedAddress": "#406", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(619) 295-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Home Brew Mart", "latitude": 32.7667586, "locationType": "tasting", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1952129, "updateDate": "2014-09-29 20:33:49", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "a7VHpi", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2012-12-07 00:05:42", "streetAddress": "10051 Old Grove Rd", "postalCode": "92131", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(858) 695-2739", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 32.898466, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.110794, "updateDate": "2014-10-13 14:28:49", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\n\nMon\u2013Fri 11:00am\u201311:00pm\r\nSaturday 11:00am\u201311:00pm\r\nSunday 11:00am\u20139:00pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Tasting Room", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2014-03-21 12:03:59", "id": "cLcfTf", "streetAddress": "2215 India St", "postalCode": "92101", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(619) 255-7213", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Tasting Room & Kitchen", "latitude": 32.7277143, "locationType": "tasting", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1697202, "updateDate": "2014-09-29 20:33:51", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-09-19 18:12:16", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1d90Lc/upload_NaZDit-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1d90Lc/upload_NaZDit-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1d90Lc/upload_NaZDit-icon.png"}, "id": "1d90Lc", "name": "Ballast Point Brewing Company"}], "description": "Our popular IPA, with a punch of heat.\r\nOur Sculpin IPA with Habanero Pepper began as a crazy experiment that\u2019s taken on a life of its own.
