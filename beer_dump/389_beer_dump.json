Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "20", "categoryId": 5, "srmMax": "14", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "4.5", "fgMin": "1.004", "fgMax": "1.016", "abvMax": "8.5", "id": 72, "srmMin": "4", "name": "French & Belgian-Style Saison"}, "updateDate": "2014-11-11 13:11:36", "abv": "5.4", "styleId": 72, "id": "mBnLmT", "statusDisplay": "New, Unverified"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.elysianbrewing.com/", "established": "1995", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "The Elysian was founded in 1995 by principals Dick Cantwell (President/Head Brewer), Joe Bisacca (CFO/Head of Operations) and David Buhler (Sales & Marketing Director). Our first Seattle location, a 220-seat beer hall and our main brewery, opened in 1996 on Capitol Hill, Seattle\u2019s most populous neighborhood. In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks\u2014a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle\u2019s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays. It is typical for us to offer over twenty different Elysian beers between the three locations.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:53", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "QbZbCr", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Seattle", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:53", "streetAddress": "1221 East Pike Street", "postalCode": "98122", "website": "http://www.elysianbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1995", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "206-860-3977", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 47.614033, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Washington", "longitude": -122.315716, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "M-F: Opens 11:30AM\r\nSat:  11AM - 11PM\r\nSun. 11AM - 10PM", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Seattle", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:14", "id": "7S4DH1", "streetAddress": "2106 N 55th St, Seattle, WA 98103", "postalCode": "98103", "website": "http://www.elysianbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1995", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "206-547-5929", "isClosed": "N", "name": "TangleTown", "latitude": 47.668918, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Washington", "longitude": -122.333473, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-11-02 12:07:05", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hvWfx5/upload_3WbnsW-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hvWfx5/upload_3WbnsW-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hvWfx5/upload_3WbnsW-icon.png"}, "id": "hvWfx5", "name": "Elysian Brewing Company"}], "description": "Amber in color with a light hop aroma and toasty malt finish.", "name": "Men's Room", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:41", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/cEwEIx/upload_dq7cQs-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/cEwEIx/upload_dq7cQs-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/cEwEIx/upload_dq7cQs-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.048", "description": "American amber/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.
