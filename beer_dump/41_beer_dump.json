By mixing these two brews, the otherwise pretty dominant cinnamon and nutmeg spices of Imperial Pumpkin Ale are subdued by Old Heathen while highlighting the malt backbone of both beers. The result is a really balanced yet spicy dark beer which will work very well as a dessert beer and still pair nicely with your favorite fall foods.\r\n\r\nSince both Old Heathen and Imperial Pumpkin Ale are each 8% ABV, Aries is also a very manageable 8% [really complicated math here].\r\n\r\nWhen Aries was originally conceived, the plan was to mix Heresy\u2014our Bourbon barrel-aged Old Heathen\u2014with Imperial Pumpkin Ale.
