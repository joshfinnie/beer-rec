We have been hard at work building this brewery keeping in mind sustainable practices and using local materials and craftsmen.

The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "mailingListUrl": "http://burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Berlin", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "id": "dB9k9t", "streetAddress": "10016 Old Ocean City Blvd", "postalCode": "21811", "website": "http://www.burleyoak.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2011", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "410-422-8887", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 38.3338561, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Maryland", "longitude": -75.2169099, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-08-28 11:21:40", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_ogqSYh-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_ogqSYh-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_ogqSYh-icon.png"}, "id": "rKXfsB", "name": "Burley Oak Craft Brewery"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Robust porters are black in color and have a roast malt flavor, often reminiscent of cocoa, but no roast barley flavor.
