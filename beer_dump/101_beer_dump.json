The first, used for strong ale or \u201cbest beer,\u201d had the most flavor, color and fermentable sugars, and produced beer with the most alcohol. The second was used for a less strong \u201ctable beer,\u201d and the third, a lighter and cheaper \u201csmall beer.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur Bone Warmer is brewed the same way, using only the first runnings from an extraordinarily thick, strong mash of Idaho 2-Row Metcalfe and Harrington barley malt, along with dark German munich and caramel malts. We subtly spiced it with \u201cnoble\u201d character American Perle and Mt. Hood hops, fermented it at cool temperatures and cold-conditioned it for smoothness and drinkability.\r\n\r\nThe resulting ale is the color of roasting chestnuts, voluptuously malty, only slightly sweet, with a hint of toffee and a warming dry finish.

During its heyday, the Skagway Brewing Company and its brew master Herman Barthel, the most technologically adorned brewer on the West coast, produced up to 30,000 barrels of beer per year and had a bottling operation on site. Multiple breweries operated out of Skagway during the peak of the Gold Rush and by 1900 competition was fierce amongst them. With the Skagway economy on a decline due to the fervor of the gold rush ending and growing prohibition support, the Skagway Brewing Company closed its doors in 1904. In 1916, the \u201cAlaska Bone Dry Law\u201d was passed effectively ending the making and consumption of alcoholic beverages in the Territory of Alaska.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, a local entrepreneur reopened the Skagway Brewing Co. in the Golden North Hotel until 2002 when it again ceased operations. With the brewing tanks collecting dust and locals thirsty for microbrews, South Dakota native and long time Skagway resident, Michael Healy spotted an opportunity and bought the equipment in 2007. Operating in a brand new building, the Skagway Brewing Company again fired up the brew tanks and on July 4th, 2007 opened its doors once again much to the pleasure of locals and visitors alike.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.
