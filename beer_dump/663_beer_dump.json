Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors.

Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors.

No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices.

Modern brewing is wonderful, of course, but sometimes a little cavorting is a fine thing. Sometimes it gives you a chance to reveal your funky side. We have to admit it - we\u2019ve been cavorting for years...and sorta holding out on you. We didn\u2019t want to do that, but the fact is that up until now we only had enough room to make this beer for ourselves and some close friends - we didn\u2019t have enough beer to put it out on shelves. We actually make a lot of beers like this - we call them the \u201cGhost Bottles\u201d, and we\u2019ve enjoyed pouring them for you at tastings and dinners.\r\n\r\nNow we\u2019re very pleased to finally give one of our \u201cghosts\u201d the opportunity to materialize in your hands. Brooklyn Wild Streak starts off as a Belgian-inspired golden ale. After fermentation and a brief conditioning, we then age the beer for several months in second-use bourbon barrels, giving it a soft, round character infused with nicely balanced oak flavors. Finally we bottle the beer flat and re-ferment it with blend of priming sugar, Champagne yeast and the wild yeast strain Brettanomyces. As the two yeasts do their cavorting, the beer gains its natural carbonation. The \u201cBrett\u201d takes many months to do its thing during bottle aging, but once it does, Wild Streak is enlivened by a wonderfully complex earthy funk.\r\n\r\nThis beer is almost one year old when released, but it will age beautifully for many more. It\u2019s particularly great with washed rind cheeses, game meats, steaks, and a few more things we probably shouldn\u2019t mention here. You\u2019ll figure it out for yourself, and that\u2019s half the fun. So go ahead - unwind that cage, pop that cork, and reveal your Wild Streak.
