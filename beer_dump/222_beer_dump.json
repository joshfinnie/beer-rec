In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting.

Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "5", "categoryId": 11, "srmMax": "50", "ibuMax": "70", "abvMin": "2.5", "fgMin": "1.006", "fgMax": "1.03", "abvMax": "12", "id": 119, "srmMin": "5", "name": "Fruit Beer"}, "updateDate": "2014-10-13 17:53:49", "abv": "2.6", "styleId": 119, "id": "t6jTmp", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.balebreaker.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Bale Breaker Brewing Company is a new brewery in Moxee, WA, but our story starts back in 1932, when our great-grandparents planted our family\u2019s first five-acre hop field in the Yakima Valley.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "srmMax": "100", "ibuMax": "100", "abvMin": "2.5", "fgMin": "1.006", "fgMax": "1.03", "abvMax": "25", "id": 125, "srmMin": "1", "name": "Specialty Beer"}, "name": "Fifteenth Anniversary St. Croix Maple Ale", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "updateDate": "2012-03-22 13:05:29", "styleId": 125, "availableId": 4, "id": "eD4pzV", "glasswareId": 5}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available during the summer months.", "id": 6, "name": "Summer"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.christianmoerlein.com/", "established": "1853", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "The Christian Moerlein Brewing Company was founded in Cincinnati, Ohio's Over-the-Rhine Brewery District in 1853 by its German immigrant namesake Mr. Christian Moerlein. By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:50", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:50", "id": "qo6LCf", "streetAddress": "1621 Moore St.", "postalCode": "45202", "website": "http://www.christianmoerlein.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1853", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-827-6025", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery, General Offices and Taproom", "latitude": 39.1137948, "locationType": "production", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5150108, "updateDate": "2014-07-27 12:11:20", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nTue:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nThu:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2012-08-02 18:10:31", "id": "X0HMO8", "streetAddress": "115 Joe Nuxhall Way", "postalCode": "45202", "website": "http://www.moerleinlagerhouse.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2012", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-421-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Christian Moerlein Lager House", "latitude": 39.0963619, "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5087017, "updateDate": "2014-07-27 12:10:27", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-27 12:12:28", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-icon.png"}, "id": "Em1uno", "name": "Christian Moerlein Brewing Company"}], "description": "A world-class Marzen in celebration of all things Oktoberfest.

Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "id": 136, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer"}, "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.cascadebrewing.com/", "established": "1998", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Cascade Brewing Company was established in 1998 by Art Larrance, who has been involved in Oregon's craft beer industry since its inception. Art co-founded one of the state's first microbreweries, Portland Brewing, as well as the Oregon Brewers Festival, which today is one of the world's preeminent craft beer festivals. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewmaster Ron Gansberg got his start in the Northwest wine industry. He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market.
