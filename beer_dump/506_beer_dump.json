The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its\r\nFlagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop,\r\nand R&D Series.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:03", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "KzHweV", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Eugene", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:03", "streetAddress": "272 Van Buren St", "postalCode": "97402", "website": "http://www.ninkasibrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2006", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "877-7-NINKASI", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.056855, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Oregon", "longitude": -123.10988, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-11-01 11:44:26", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-icon.png"}, "id": "V4I9FT", "name": "Ninkasi Brewing Company"}], "updateDate": "2012-11-12 10:02:37", "abv": "5.8", "styleId": 5, "availableId": 2, "id": "voQlGe", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Aged 6 months in Extra Anejo tequila barrels this interesting brew pours an orange to copper color with definite aromas and flavors of tequila, lime, mango, and other citrus, pepper, and a slight breadiness, mixed with an oaky tone from the barrels.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Sunday - Thursday: 12-8\r\nFriday and Saturday: 12-10", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Sawyer", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "id": "AlhRYb", "streetAddress": "5885 Sawyer Rd.", "postalCode": "49125", "website": "http://www.greenbushbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "269-405-1076", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.8856286, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -86.5946671, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "updateDate": "2012-04-09 18:18:49", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QJRQhZ/upload_999gvA-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QJRQhZ/upload_999gvA-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QJRQhZ/upload_999gvA-icon.png"}, "id": "QJRQhZ", "name": "Greenbush Brewing Co"}, {"website": "http://www.buckledownbrewing.com", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "BuckleDown Brewing is a small craft brewery and taproom in Lyons, IL.
