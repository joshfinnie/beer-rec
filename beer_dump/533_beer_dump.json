He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market. Even though there are an abundance of breweries in this area, it's highly competitive. To stand out amongst this group, you need to push the envelope and be out there to get to your niche and magic elixir.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:50", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "lijo4X", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Portland", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:50", "streetAddress": "7424 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy.", "postalCode": "97225", "website": "http://www.cascadebrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1998", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "503-296-0110", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 45.485627, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Oregon", "longitude": -122.753996, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-03-05 13:08:33", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fF1DVj/upload_4r2XOB-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fF1DVj/upload_4r2XOB-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fF1DVj/upload_4r2XOB-icon.png"}, "id": "fF1DVj", "name": "Cascade Brewing"}], "updateDate": "2014-04-02 11:16:31", "abv": "9.3", "styleId": 40, "id": "MQEc0Y", "name": "Sang Noir"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Limited availability.", "id": 2, "name": "Limited"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Saison brewed with unique Arizona red limes", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-08-12 21:44:44", "breweries": [{"website": "http://oakcreekbrew.com/", "established": "1993", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "The Kraus family came to Sedona in 1993 with all their worldly goods and a dream, to brew great fresh beer the way Fred learned at the Gasthausbrauerei Hufeisen, or Horseshoe Brewery, in the picturesque village of Pottenstein, Germany.
