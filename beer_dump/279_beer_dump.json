Linus and Lila Hall moved to Nashville from Mississippi in 1996, with Linus going to work as a tire engineer for Bridgestone and Lila as a curator for the Parthenon. Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery. Yazoo Brewing opened for business in Oct 2003, and quickly gained an enthusiastic local following.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:13", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Thu:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nSat:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nWednesday are Growler fills only", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Nashville", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:13", "id": "preZog", "streetAddress": "910 Division St", "postalCode": "37203", "website": "http://www.yazoobrew.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2003", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "615-891-4649", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 36.1509754, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Tennessee", "longitude": -86.7821302, "updateDate": "2014-08-23 15:00:53", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-10-22 13:20:04", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gUJBgl/upload_P8vokp-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gUJBgl/upload_P8vokp-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gUJBgl/upload_P8vokp-icon.png"}, "id": "gUJBgl", "name": "Yazoo Brewing Company"}], "name": "Helles Bock Lager", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-03-25 13:23:21", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Pnv6AF/upload_l83j2w-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Pnv6AF/upload_l83j2w-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Pnv6AF/upload_l83j2w-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 7, "name": "European-germanic Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "71LkGn", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Munster", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "streetAddress": "9750 Indiana Parkway", "postalCode": "46321", "website": "http://www.threefloydspub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-219-922-3565", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.535536, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -87.516687, "updateDate": "2014-10-20 15:53:00", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "GoDmMT", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Munster", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:16", "streetAddress": "9750 Indiana Parkway", "postalCode": "46321", "website": "http://www.3floyds.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "219-922-4425", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Munster", "latitude": 41.535536, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -87.516687, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-08-09 13:56:10", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_WREfmT-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_WREfmT-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_WREfmT-icon.png"}, "id": "iodDki", "name": "Three Floyds Brewing Company"}], "description": "An oatmeal stout brewed with Intelligentsia coffee. \u201cRichard yet lives, Hell\u2019s Black Intelligencer\u201d \u2013 Queen Margaret, Richard III.", "name": "Hell\u2019s Black Intelligencer", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:22", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/kUruT1/upload_toPNnN-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/kUruT1/upload_toPNnN-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/kUruT1/upload_toPNnN-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.038", "description": "Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.

Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present.
