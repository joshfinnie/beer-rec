In our country we have a great brewing tradition of marking these events with special celebratory ales. Raising glasses in national celebration is where public houses come into their own providing the perfect place for friends and neighbours to celebrate.  In recent years we brewed \u2018Celebration Ale\u2019 to mark the Queen\u2019s Silver Jubilee in 1977 and \u2018Prince of Ales\u2019 in 1981 to mark the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana. Now, 2012 promises to be another great year for that purpose with Her Majesty the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee, a remarkable achievement. But 2012 is also a special year for Theakstons as this is 185th anniversary of the founding of the company by Robert Theakston. To mark these events we have brewed a 'right royal brew', Theakston Royal Salute. The beer, only available in cask, is a 5% ABV pale ale brew using the finest pale and crystal barley, Target, Challenger and Progress bitter hops and generous amounts of Sovereign hops for fruit flavour! A wondeful accompaniment for such aptly named dishes such as Coronation Chicken and Julbilee Chicken! Also delicious with light curriee and rich desserts.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-08-02 01:33:06", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.theakstons.co.uk/", "established": "1827", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "T&R Theakston Ltd is an independent, family brewing company founded in 1827 located in the Yorkshire Dales market town of Masham, North Yorkshire.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties).

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.
