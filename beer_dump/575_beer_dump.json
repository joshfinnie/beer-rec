Creativity is something we value in our Ales and it\u2019s our goal to incorporate regional ingredients into beers that go beyond convention. Brewing to style is not our objective; we prefer to focus our explorations on the potential of beer.\r\n\r\nBut we\u2019re more than just brewing, we\u2019ve got good food to boot. The Prodigal Son features a menu that combines traditional pub fare with scratch cooking. Here you will find regional ingredients incorporated into handcrafted cuisine. We have a bona fide chef with an artist\u2019s muse- and his work is truly the product of inspiration. Our food is unique \u2013you might even say it has character.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re proud to be back home, here in Eastern Oregon. Come visit anytime, and stay as long as you like. We hope you will join us on our journey to beervana.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties).
