Let\u2019s start a craft beer brewery!\u201d  That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality.  They quit their day jobs.  \r\n\r\nWith that leap of faith \u2013 and a ton of support from many friends and family \u2013 they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer \u2013 AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.  Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite \u201cgo to\u201d beer.  \r\n\r\nBy October the brewery was complete and cooking.  And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving\u2026 in Jon\u2019s car.  Lucid was on its way!\r\n\r\nAlways keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover\u2019s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers\u2019 demands.

Often, though not always, brewed with dark Belgian \"candy\" sugar, these beers can be well attenuated, ranging from medium to full-bodied. The perception of hop bitterness is low to medium, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. Fruity complexity along with the soft flavors of roasted malts add distinct character. The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived.

Stories not based on \"who was who's\" side... but more of the drama,the guts and the lifestyle of the soldiers on both sides. Not to make someone feel as though they are getting whopped over the head with history and facts... the beers...such as \"Old Wooden Head\" (our Imperial IPA... named for Confederate General John Bell Hood...who was a principal player in the battle.. and nicknamed that by this troops for his tenacity)... are made more for the spirit and the feel of the time...mixed with a modern cool feel.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-24 10:56:35", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "So1N3d", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Kennesaw", "createDate": "2012-01-24 10:57:46", "streetAddress": "2260 Moon Station Ct", "latitude": 34.033027, "extendedAddress": "Suite 210", "website": "http://www.burnthickorybrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2010", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "30144", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Georgia", "longitude": -84.61663, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-11-22 16:13:40", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/kOR0Vy/upload_2cOdG6-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/kOR0Vy/upload_2cOdG6-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/kOR0Vy/upload_2cOdG6-icon.png"}, "id": "kOR0Vy", "name": "Burnt Hickory Brewery"}], "name": "Cannon Dragger", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-03-06 20:28:57", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/KxMndf/upload_DpLpqr-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/KxMndf/upload_DpLpqr-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/KxMndf/upload_DpLpqr-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
