Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

The idea spread as friends tasted the unique beers, and the popularity of those early batches encouraged a dedicated team of three partners to begin working to make the dream of a local brewery a reality. Mark Seibold, JD Merryweather and Daniel Mercer spent the next two years traveling throughout the United States, Europe and Central America visiting breweries and sampling local flavors. The insight gained from entrepreneurs, brewers, biologists, operations personnel and consumers provided an invaluable basis for a serious endeavor into quality commercial brewing. By integrating this knowledge with the local, regional and national brewing trends, as well as local feedback, the trio planned the birth and growth of the yet unnamed COOP. After nearly 3 years of research, comprising thousands of man hours and dozens of test batches, COOP fashioned its identity as a steadfast professional team that holds closely a passion for bringing quality, local beer to taps and homes in Oklahoma City and beyond.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith the help of close friends and fellow craft-beer fans, COOP was capitalized on July 15th, 2008. In less than 6 months, the COOP team; navigated the multi-layered regulatory process, secured a building lease, completed the remodel, purchased and installed a commercial brewery, obtained brewing licenses from the State of Oklahoma and the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, created and branded original recipe beers and brewed the first full scale batches for distribution.\r\n\r\nThe outpouring of support that has come from friends of the COOP team has been overwhelming.
