After a few years of chasing the academic and corporate dollar, the boys wised up and decided to strike out on their own.  They landed in Vancouver, WA (which was the first Vancouver, by the way) and started up Dirty Hands Brewing Company.  From the start, their goal was to brew full flavored beers that were both balanced and highly drinkable.  So, they set to work, getting their hands dirty renovating the space that was the old Columbian Newspaper building to a working brewery and taproom.  Speaking of the newspaper, that\u2019s how the name came about.  Think of reading a hard copy paper and how your hands would look from getting newsprint all over them!

Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not.
