Established in 2003, its beer has gone on to be the most popular British bottled beer sold in Canada, and second most popular in Sweden. It was part of the nominated drinks list for the G8 Summit 2005 at Gleneagles Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe business is, since 2008, family owned following a management buy-out from its original part-owners, William Grant and Sons.\r\n\r\nTheir Innis & Gunn Original beer is brewed in Dunbar, East Lothian before being matured in American white oak Bourbon barrels for 30 days and is then a further 47 days in a marrying tun, and so it is matured for 77 days in total. It is 6.6% alcohol by volume. At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught.\r\n\r\nAccording to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.\r\n\r\nA \"blonde\" version of Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum barrels was produced.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-08-03 00:34:11", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.innisandgunn.com/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 55.951976, "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Edinburgh", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "longitude": -3.211095, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "+44 (0) 131 337 4420", "streetAddress": "6 Randolph Crescent", "createDate": "2012-08-03 12:39:07", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}, "postalCode": "EH3 7TH", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "0HAazs", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-08-03 12:40:12", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-icon.png"}, "id": "jC0TAa", "name": "Innis & Gunn"}], "name": "Scottish Pale Ale", "createDate": "2012-10-10 12:32:29", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/VWB9bY/upload_fEJtiV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/VWB9bY/upload_fEJtiV-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/VWB9bY/upload_fEJtiV-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.072", "description": "Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied.

They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops.\n\nSome stories have twists, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery. Risking life and limb (while keeping his mouth open to sample the beer), a heroic brewery team member took the dive reconnecting the valve and saving about half the batch of Scratch #19.\n\nSo for your amusement (and our final relief), we give you a draft-only release of a third-take on a style that demands continued research for the Troegs Brewery staff.

Once this uber-high gravity wort made it to the kettle, we added a combination of Magnum hops for bittering, and Saaz hops for an herbal contrast to the caramel malts, along with Demararra sugar. For a unique twist on this style, we used a combination of Saaz whole-leaf hops, and more than 40 pounds of Zante currants in the hopback.\r\n\r\nWe pitched Westmalle yeast for a complimenting spicy balance and after a long fermentation, we give you Scratch #44\u2014an interesting spin to a style that\u2019s been enjoyed for centuries.\r\n\r\nO.G.: 21.1 \r\nMalt: Pils, Munich, Melanoidin, Special B, CaraBelge \r\nHops: Magnum, Saaz \r\nYeast: Westmalle \r\nJuju: Demararra sugar, Zante currants \r\nCode: Team America (Metal Brewer Champions!)", "name": "Scratch #44 Belgian Brown (2011)", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:44:11", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.troegs.com/", "established": "1997", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Tr\u00f6egs Brewing Company was established in 1997 by brothers Chris and John Trogner.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:11", "mailingListUrl": "http://www.troegs.com/about_us/newsletter.aspx", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Sun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\nGeneral Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Hershey", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:11", "id": "C6iHOv", "streetAddress": "200 E Hersheypark Dr", "postalCode": "17033", "website": "http://www.troegs.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1997", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "717-232-1297", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 40.2972852, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -76.6428527, "updateDate": "2014-10-02 18:04:49", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-10-02 15:58:31", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_3yONkx-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_3yONkx-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_3yONkx-icon.png"}, "id": "n5QFi2", "name": "Tr\u00f6egs Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
