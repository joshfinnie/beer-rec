Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "25", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "6.2", "fgMin": "1.016", "fgMax": "1.028", "abvMax": "8", "id": 15, "srmMin": "15", "name": "Scotch Ale"}, "updateDate": "2012-06-10 23:15:10", "abv": "8", "styleId": 15, "availableId": 4, "id": "t1UOsF", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Limited availability.", "id": 2, "name": "Limited"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "The first in our Farmhouse Series, Glenn is brewed with fresh blood oranges and corriander.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-10-14 15:22:13", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.springhousebeer.com/", "established": "2006", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Located in Conestoga, PA in the heart of Lancaster County.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.springhousebeer.com/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Conestoga", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Pennsylvania", "countryIsoCode": "US", "longitude": -76.329515, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 39.9525, "streetAddress": "2519 Main St.", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "17516", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "RwaR3B", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nTue - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 11:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Lancaster", "createDate": "2013-03-03 21:13:34", "id": "yQQSln", "streetAddress": "25 West King Street", "postalCode": "17603", "website": "http://www.springhousebeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(717) 399-4009", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Taproom", "latitude": 40.038495, "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -76.306957, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-08-12 23:44:10", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W0G7sk/upload_h98Shl-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W0G7sk/upload_h98Shl-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W0G7sk/upload_h98Shl-icon.png"}, "id": "W0G7sk", "name": "Spring House Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.055", "description": "Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

During \u201cBrew Nights,\u201d friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.\r\n\r\nPine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities.
