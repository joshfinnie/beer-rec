Alva was chosen as the location as this allowed us to carry on using the outstanding soft water from the Ochil Hills.\r\n\r\nHarviestoun Brewery was later bought by Caledonian Brewery in 2006. However, in the wake of the acquisition of Caledonian brewing Company by Scottish & Newcastle UK, the brewery became independent once again in 2008 by three noble shareholders who sought to preserve the status as an independent award-winning micro-brewery. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Harviestoun is going through some new and exciting changes to expand the brewery. We are working hard to increase production, while insuring that we still outputting nothing but quality beer.
