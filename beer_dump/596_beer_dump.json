Inspired by the bountiful sunflowers grown in the pub's beer garden, our IPA has a deep golden color and distinct yet subtle citrus flavors that satisfy both the diehard IPA drinker and those who prefer a lighter palate. Sunflower IPA is truly a beer for the masses. McMenamins artists Lyle Hehn, Myrna Yoder and Jenny Joyce were each asked to design a label for the new IPA.
