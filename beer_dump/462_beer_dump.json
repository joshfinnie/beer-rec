The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

In the beginning we had only one ale, the Guldenberg, named after the Guldenberg Abbey in Wevelgem, where beer was brewed in the past. With a history in the beer world (since 1930 the Bacelle - Noffels family was active in beer commerce and as a lemonade producer), Nino had started experimenting with brewing ale in 1981. After an education as brewer at the CTL in Ghent in the mid eighties, he kept experimenting and in the nineties he thought his time had come (and his ale was good enough) to commercialize his ale. After a decent study of the possibilities to start his own brewery, he decided to start with brewing in a existing brewery. The good thing about this formula is that it\u2019s possible to brew profitable without big investments. The Deca brewery is Woesten was chosen to do this and in the first year 9000 litres of Guldenberg were brewed.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "qBSM79", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Wevelgem", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "streetAddress": "Brugsstraat 43", "latitude": 50.8104527, "website": "http://deranke.be/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1994", "countryIsoCode": "BE", "phone": "32-056-41-82-41", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "West-Vlaanderen", "longitude": 3.1857196, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Belgium", "name": "BELGIUM", "isoThree": "BEL", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 56, "isoCode": "BE"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-03-21 19:06:04", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/C7C49d/upload_ZTLrqN-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/C7C49d/upload_ZTLrqN-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/C7C49d/upload_ZTLrqN-icon.png"}, "id": "C7C49d", "name": "Brouwerij De Ranke"}], "name": "P\u00e8re No\u00ebl", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:54", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/PEt9ZM/upload_1gAkjG-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/PEt9ZM/upload_1gAkjG-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/PEt9ZM/upload_1gAkjG-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.064", "description": "Belgian dark strong ales are amber to dark brown in color.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "id": 132, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer"}, "updateDate": "2014-07-10 13:16:29", "styleId": 132, "id": "8uChfX", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "numberOfPages": 683}
