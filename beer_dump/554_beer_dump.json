They first met in 2005 while going to the University of Minnesota for bachelor degrees in Electrical Engineering. Over time, they all worked together as hardware design engineers for a small engineering services company specializing in RF-centric products. Being young engineers working downtown Minneapolis, they attended various happy hours together. It quickly became clear that they all really loved craft beer and were very intrigued with the science of the brewing process.\r\n\r\nJake and Jeff are the two brewers of the company who designed and honed the recipes. They got their start in 2006 brewing extract kits on Jake's Mom's kitchen stove much to her chagrin. (A few boil-overs did occur on her stove, whoops!) They brewed countless extract kits until in 2010, when after touring Surly and Flat Earth, they were inspired to turn their passion (like the founders of those breweries) into a business. From that point forward it has been all grain brewing and loving it. Nowadays, Jake focuses on the brewing aspect of the business while Jeff focuses on the brewing as well as the business side of the operation.\r\n\r\nGeorge, in the early years, was a force within the brewery by helping out at every brew session and providing needed muscle for cleaning and moving material around the brewhouse. He focused a lot on the quality of our beer and pushed us to design better more complex beers. He has moved on to be in charge of our online presence including developing our own beer wiki engine.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Wednesday: 4-10PM\r\nThursday 4-10PM\r\nFriday 3-11PM\r\nSaturday 12-11PM", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "St. Paul", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "id": "06ughl", "streetAddress": "125 E 9th St.", "postalCode": "55101", "extendedAddress": "Unit 127", "website": "http://twbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2014", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(651) 330-4734", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Tin Whiskers Brewery and Taproom", "latitude": 44.9506615, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Minnesota", "longitude": -93.09361, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 14:09:11", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HhKKA6/upload_Oo4Qmh-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HhKKA6/upload_Oo4Qmh-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HhKKA6/upload_Oo4Qmh-icon.png"}, "id": "HhKKA6", "name": "Tin Whiskers Brewing Company"}], "description": "Short Circuit Stout is a full-bodied and roasty stout with a lingering sweet aftertaste.
