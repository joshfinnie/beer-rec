Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottishstyle light ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style light ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "9", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "17", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "2.8", "fgMin": "1.006", "fgMax": "1.012", "abvMax": "3.5", "id": 7, "srmMin": "8", "name": "Scottish-Style Light Ale"}, "updateDate": "2014-04-30 09:13:22", "styleId": 7, "id": "uf5uHx", "glasswareId": 5}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Brewed every year for the Pemaquid Oyster Festival in Damariscotta, this riich, chocolatey brew benefits from having ten dozen live oysters involved in the beer....mmmm oysters.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-04-23 18:00:55", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.marshallwharf.com/", "established": "2007", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "We have 17 draft lines dedicated to our beers.
