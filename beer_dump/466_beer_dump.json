Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices.
