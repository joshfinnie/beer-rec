Through the integration of sustainable production methods, environmentally conscious waste management and innovative water recycling/reclamation techniques, we hope to become a model for breweries and agricultural destinations throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nThe BrewhouseThe brew house is an engineered mix of new and old technologies and techniques. Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-11-18 12:30:28", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  10:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Traverse City", "createDate": "2013-11-18 12:32:00", "id": "1QFuku", "streetAddress": "2959 Hartman Rd", "postalCode": "49685", "website": "http://www.breweryterrafirma.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2013", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(231) 929-1600", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.7154521, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -85.6354376, "updateDate": "2014-09-29 20:36:47", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-11-18 12:30:28", "id": "dvuEzd", "name": "Brewery Terra Firma"}], "name": "Ancho Chili Double Chocolate Porter", "createDate": "2013-11-26 12:49:09", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/BLDAuC/upload_LP2zXl-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/BLDAuC/upload_LP2zXl-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/BLDAuC/upload_LP2zXl-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Robust porters are black in color and have a roast malt flavor, often reminiscent of cocoa, but no roast barley flavor.

As early as 1849, India Pale Ale - prepared by British brewers for export to India by adding dry hops to barrels of hoppy ale - was also heading west, from England around the Horn to San Francisco. Thirsty \u201849ers savored the best imported IPAs, but it wasn\u2019t until 1975 that Anchor, Americas' original craft brewery, pioneered the revival of dry-hopped handmade ales. Now, that tradition fast-forwards to an adventurous new brew: Anchor IPA\u2122.\r\n\r\nAnchor IPA\u2122 is made with 2-row barley malt and fresh whole-cone hops, its bright amber color, distinctively complex aroma, spiky bitterness, malty depth, and clean finish unite to create a uniquely flavorful, memorable, and timeless craft IPA.\r\n\r\nThe elephant you see on Anchor IPA\u2122 was hand-drawn by our label artist, James Stitt. To \"see the elephant\" was a popular 19th-century expression that originated with a tale that predates the California Gold Rush.\r\n\r\nThere once lived a farmer who had heard of elephants but had never seen one. He longed for the day when he might catch a glimpse of this rare, exotic creature. When the circus came to town, he loaded his wagon with fresh produce and headed to market. On the way, just as he'd hoped, he came across the circus parade, nobly led by an enormous elephant. The farmer was ecstatic, but his horses were terrified. They reared and bucked, overturning his wagon and scattering its precious contents in the road. \"I don\u2019t give a hoot,\" exclaimed the farmer. \"I have seen the elephant!\"\r\n\r\nThe elephant became the universal symbol of the Gold Rush, as evidenced by the journals, letters, and sketchbooks of the forty-niners. Whether or not they struck it rich in the diggings, those plucky pioneers would forever treasure their California adventure as the defining moment of their lives.

Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its\r\nFlagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop,\r\nand R&D Series.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:03", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "KzHweV", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Eugene", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:03", "streetAddress": "272 Van Buren St", "postalCode": "97402", "website": "http://www.ninkasibrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2006", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "877-7-NINKASI", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.056855, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Oregon", "longitude": -123.10988, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-11-01 11:44:26", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-icon.png"}, "id": "V4I9FT", "name": "Ninkasi Brewing Company"}], "description": "Ancient Aleiens honors the end of the Mayan Calendar and celebrates the last beer festival of modern civilization - the Holiday Ale Festival.
