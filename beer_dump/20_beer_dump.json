This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

They quit their day jobs.  \r\n\r\nWith that leap of faith \u2013 and a ton of support from many friends and family \u2013 they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer \u2013 AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.  Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite \u201cgo to\u201d beer.  \r\n\r\nBy October the brewery was complete and cooking.  And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving\u2026 in Jon\u2019s car.  Lucid was on its way!\r\n\r\nAlways keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover\u2019s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers\u2019 demands.

From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  8:00am - 5:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 5:00pm\n\nBusiness hours:\r\n8 a.m. - 5 p.m., Monday - Friday\r\n\r\nGift shop and tour hours:\r\nWinter Hours: October - April: 11 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., Tuesday - Saturday\r\nSummer Hours: May - September: 11 a.m. - 6 p.m., 7 days a week", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Juneau", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "id": "krIs45", "streetAddress": "5429 Shaune Drive", "postalCode": "99801", "website": "http://www.alaskanbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1986", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "907-780-5866", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 58.3570171, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Alaska", "longitude": -134.4893459, "updateDate": "2014-08-25 19:12:27", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-08-09 19:04:06", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_32dIr0-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_32dIr0-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_32dIr0-icon.png"}, "id": "VPHkaP", "name": "Alaskan Brewing Company"}], "description": "Alt.

The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "10", "categoryId": 4, "srmMax": "18", "ibuMax": "15", "abvMin": "4.9", "fgMin": "1.008", "fgMax": "1.016", "abvMax": "5.5", "id": 54, "srmMin": "4", "name": "Bamberg-Style Weiss (Smoke) Rauchbier (Dunkel or Helles)"}, "name": "Alaskan Smoked Porter", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "updateDate": "2014-11-06 18:01:30", "abv": "6.5", "styleId": 54, "availableId": 2, "id": "39bZWW", "glasswareId": 5}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.alaskanbeer.com/", "established": "1986", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Alaska has a rich history of brewing.
