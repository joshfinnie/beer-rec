In 2007 the Baltika #3 bottle received an embossed lettering. At the same time the brand was produced in a one-liter aluminum can that was new for the market.

Baltika \u21164 is a dark drink produced with rye malt, which adds bread flavor and light bitterness to the taste. The Original sort is now steadily popular and has dedicated lovers throughout Russia.\r\nBaltika #4 is traditionally produced only at St. Petersburg brewery. From this place it is taken all over Russia and exported to almost 30 countries of the world.\r\n\r\nBaltika #4 has won a number of top prizes of international professional contests. In September 2004 Baltika #4 was among the 50 top brands of the world by the results of the annual International Beer Challenge Contest. All the brands participating in the contest are divided into 12 classes and are strictly assessed by their flavor and package by the leading experts in brewing. The jury includes both consumers and specialists in marketing and packaging.\r\n\r\nTwo times running, in 2007 and 2008, Baltika #4 won the silver medals of the Australian International Beer Awards Contest in the category of Lager Packaged.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Baltika #4 Original brought the Company the Gold Medal of the European Beer Star Awards Contest in the category of Red and Amber Beer. This is the top award of one of the most prestigious contests of the world brewing. The contest was organized by the Association of Private Breweries of Germany and the Association of Independent Breweries of Europe. One of the conditions of the participation is strict compliance with the traditional laws of European brewing. The jury of 65 experts in brewing from 16 countries evaluated the available brands in 40 categories. The samples were traditionally tasted by \"blind testing,\" which guaranteed unbiased evaluation.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-07-10 14:28:47", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/eJUSFw/upload_4TqhEz-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/eJUSFw/upload_4TqhEz-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/eJUSFw/upload_4TqhEz-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 7, "name": "European-germanic Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.048", "description": "These light brown to dark brown beers have a pronounced malty aroma and flavor that dominates over the clean, crisp, moderate hop bitterness.

The point being, we make complex, delicate, nuanced beers, not just the same typical west coast hop bombs or dark extremely high alcohol brews (though we make quality versions of those too). Our goal is to show the whole spectrum of beer, its history, and its evolution. To show beer its proper reverence, as not only \"The people's beverage\", but one that pairs as well with food as wine, and when it's skillfully crafted and not over hopped to hide the flaws in production, it does. The truth is, it takes more skill to make a delicate lager, than a double IPA.

After several years of apprenticing with other master brewers, Mark was ready to begin crafting beer using his own recipes.\r\n\r\nHe found the perfect spot in Charlottesville, VA; a historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state of Virginia\u2019s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Mark re-opened the doors and introduced the Starr Hill Brewery. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its historic building with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall, and it was there that Mark's delicious craft beers became a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world. Nineteen prestigious awards later, Mark\u2019s brews continue to be a hit at beer and music festivals nationwide.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, in response to the growing demand, Mark moved from this small brewing operation to a larger brewing facility several miles outside of town, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's core and seasonal brews are now enjoyed in restaurants and music clubs throughout the Mid Atlantic and Southeast, and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores in the region.\r\n\r\nMark is proud of the awards his microbrews have earned, and the experts agree that he is among the best craft brewers in the country.

Produced in collaboration with our good friend and masterful sake home-brewer, Todd Bellomy, this has been one of the most interesting and labor-intensive beers ever to come out of CBC.\r\nWe began last December by spending many cold, windy days in the alley behind the brewery, steaming rice in small batches to brew what became almost fifty gallons of pure sake. Sake is produced by multiple parallel fermentation: polished rice is converted to sugar by a fungus called Koji (Aspergillus oryzae) and fermentation is taken care of by sake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae kyokai). After several weeks of fermentation this batch of sake (possibly the largest batch of sake ever made in New England) was destined to become the starter for our beer.\r\nJust after Christmas, Todd joined us again to brew a mere six barrels of the craziest beer wort ever. Pale barley malt and flaked rice went into the mash, and after extracting only the first runnings we added a significant amount of brown rice syrup. This yielded a wort of 31*P/1.124SG, or in other words, some really thick, sticky stuff! The wort was sent to the fermenter and then, with fingers crossed, we pumped over the entire batch of sake including the yeast, Koji, and lots of rice slurry. Fermentation was slow and low at 50*F for six weeks, followed by cold-conditioning until it reached more than 15%abv!\r\nIncredibly complex aromas and flavors abound, including sweet rice, fresh apples and grapes, hints of earth and mushroom from the koji, and as it warms further notes of fennel, herbs, and an almost Belgian-yeast spiciness. Brilliant copper-colored, it is full in body despite its very dry finish. This is one to be sipped, savored, and contemplated. Banryu Ichi is a truly unique beverage, served with intentionally very low carbonation in a 5oz. glass set inside a Masu, a traditional cedar sake cup.\r\nKampai!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:45", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.cambrew.com/", "established": "1989", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "CBC blends a passion for fresh, flavorful beer and delicious, imaginative cuisine to create a one-of-a-kind dining experience for greater Boston.
