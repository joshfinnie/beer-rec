After several years of apprenticing with other master brewers, Mark was ready to begin crafting beer using his own recipes.\r\n\r\nHe found the perfect spot in Charlottesville, VA; a historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state of Virginia\u2019s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Mark re-opened the doors and introduced the Starr Hill Brewery. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its historic building with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall, and it was there that Mark's delicious craft beers became a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world. Nineteen prestigious awards later, Mark\u2019s brews continue to be a hit at beer and music festivals nationwide.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, in response to the growing demand, Mark moved from this small brewing operation to a larger brewing facility several miles outside of town, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's core and seasonal brews are now enjoyed in restaurants and music clubs throughout the Mid Atlantic and Southeast, and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores in the region.\r\n\r\nMark is proud of the awards his microbrews have earned, and the experts agree that he is among the best craft brewers in the country.

This beer is commonly over looked and is a true Ninja of a beer.

Inspired by almost everything from Belgium (beer, women, mussels) we thought it would be cool to give our Amber a little Belgian love. So we used a yeast that is ALMOST like a Belgian yeast strain. You'll notice it in the aroma but mostly in the flavor.

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston. We have a public open house every weekday at 3:00 PM and every Saturday starting at 11:00 AM.\r\n\r\nCheers!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "mailingListUrl": "http://visitor.constantcontact.com/manage/optin?v=001uBxRG66eq3ajbdfZ6GjL91di7O20EmmX", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "jPbb33", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Houston", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "streetAddress": "2000 Lyons Avenue", "postalCode": "77020", "website": "http://www.saintarnold.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1994", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "713-686-9494", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 29.7715192, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Texas", "longitude": -95.3484972, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-08-13 18:32:47", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H3UW27/upload_Ssjtzj-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H3UW27/upload_Ssjtzj-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H3UW27/upload_Ssjtzj-icon.png"}, "id": "H3UW27", "name": "Saint Arnold Brewing Company"}], "name": "Amber Ale - Dry Hopped with Liberty Hops", "createDate": "2014-06-19 12:29:08", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/zcaBCu/upload_2ecCrW-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/zcaBCu/upload_2ecCrW-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/zcaBCu/upload_2ecCrW-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.048", "description": "American amber/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.
