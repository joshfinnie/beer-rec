By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 151,000 barrels of beer and 9,100 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "locations": [{"openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "d8IJKF", "locationTypeDisplay": "Office", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Abita Springs", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "streetAddress": "PO Box 1510", "postalCode": "70420", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1986", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "800-737-2311", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 30.482408, "locationType": "office", "region": "Louisiana", "longitude": -90.056605, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Tasting Room", "locality": "Abita Springs", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Louisiana", "longitude": -90.055185, "hoursOfOperation": "Wed:  2:00pm - 3:00pm\nThu:  2:00pm - 3:00pm\nFri:  2:00pm - 3:00pm\nSat:  10:00am - 3:00pm\n\n", "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 30.482138, "streetAddress": "21084 Louisiana 36", "createDate": "2012-09-29 14:34:50", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:38:49", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "70433", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "PdSE1h", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Tue:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Abita Springs", "createDate": "2012-09-29 14:36:40", "id": "1xB2B8", "streetAddress": "72011 Holly Street", "postalCode": "70420", "website": "http://www.abitabrewpub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2004", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(985) 892-5837", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Brewpub", "latitude": 30.4787288, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Louisiana", "longitude": -90.0388438, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:38:50", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-08-12 21:42:59", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BBE5WM/upload_WCZDku-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BBE5WM/upload_WCZDku-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BBE5WM/upload_WCZDku-icon.png"}, "id": "BBE5WM", "name": "Abita Brewing Company"}], "name": "Spring IPA", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-02-02 12:36:23", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/VOItON/upload_cZB3NI-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/VOItON/upload_cZB3NI-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/VOItON/upload_cZB3NI-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale.
