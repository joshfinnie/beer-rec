This milestone not only exemplifies their continuing commitment to amazing craft beer, but also signals a shift in focus for the brewery towards more innovative recipes and concepts.\r\n\r\nHeaded up by a small group of impassioned beer lovers including head brewer Garett Lockhart, Red Brick is determined to lead the charge in the south, putting out excellent beers such as \"Hoplanta\" IPA and the upcoming winter release \"Sacred Cow\" chai milk stout. They also take time to push the limits of brewing with the \"Brick Mason\" series, which the staff sees as their continuing masterpiece. Highlights from this series include \"The Lost Years\" old ale, \"Black-Eye Rye\" American black ale, and the most recent release \"20th Anniversary\", a 10% Imperial stout that was aged in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels. Early accolades have already compared it to the hallowed KBS.\r\n\r\nThe future keeps looking brighter and brighter for this brewery, and the next couple years will see them growing and experimenting with diverse styles, collaborating with fellow breweries, implementing a new barrel program, and continuing to raise the bar for themselves in all aspects.

Armed with a we can do this attitude the three cast off from their careers in engineering and biology to found the Wachusett Brewing Co. in 1993. Wachusett Country Ale was introduced to beer fans of Massachusetts the next year after lots of experimenting to get the formula just right. When Wachusett opened, the three designed and built most of the equipment; did the brewing and filling, selling and delivering, and everything else that a small startup brewery needed. Ned, Kevin and Peter are now backed by some of the most passionate and capable co-workers in the industry. Wachusett Ales continue to be hand crafted with the finest ingredients available, bottled and kegged in our Westminster facility.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

As the name suggests, our beer a true fusions\u00f8l where we with arms and legs have stolen inspiration from several different styles - and from several countries.\r\n \r\nThe yeast we have used is a classic German pilsnerg\u00e6r, which we very much against its will has been fermented at 22 degrees Celsius - a technique familiar from the American beer \"California Common\" or \"Steam Beer\". In this way, we combine the crisp freshness of lager with a portion of fruity freshness that you experience in top-fermented beer.\r\n \r\nThe malt that we use is no ordinary election, we have grabbed the bag with English Mild Ale malt, which give the beer its dark roasted character, while a handful of German caramel malt gives a little sweetness and roundness.\r\n \r\nAnd then it would not be a real Amager beer if we had extremely generous with the hops. Here our choice fell on the classic American aromahumler Centennial, Chinook and Amarillo - You know how someone massaging the taste buds. And then leave these hops the most enjoyable, citrusy freshness.\r\n \r\nAre you confused? Well, that's no reason to. Amager Summer Fusion is the answer to the many who for years have been asking: \"When will we have an American-English German-of-bottom-fermented lager ale that tastes a lot without being bimmelim?\"\r\n \r\nAmager Summer Fusion was contributed from Amager Brewery to competition in the beer festival 2007 to find the perfect summer beer at max. 3.5% alcohol.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-05-17 21:37:12", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.amagerbryghus.dk/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Our small microbrewery is located in a picturesque industrial neighbourhood near the Danish capital, Copenhagen, and the airport in the city of Taarnby. There is absolute no doubt that we run the safest brewing enterprise in the country as our premises used to be an air-raid shelter. Our premises have also been used for storing bibles, hence reigns an atmosphere of divine tranquillity only otherwise found in Belgian monasteries. Well...\r\n \r\nFounders of the brewery are the two friends and dedicated home brewers Mr. Morten Valentin Lundsbak and Mr. Jacob Storm, who since the opening of the brewery have achieved diplomas of their skills as they have become Diploma Brewers at the Scandinavian School of Brewing.\r\n \r\nIt is our ambition to cater to all beer lovers - every time, which is why we only use pure ingredients during the brewing process. We make no shortcuts by using artificial additives to speed or help the processes. Furthermore, we have deliberately chosen neither to pasteurize nor filter our beer as we would like to preserve the best possible flavours and aromas.\r\n \r\nWe allow the beer to mature completely in the bottle before releasing it to the market. This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment. And preferably use a high pour to get the full and frothy head as well as to release all the pleasant aromas from this well-brewed beer from Amager Bryghus.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-03-06 18:54:21", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.amagerbryghus.dk/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 55.624252, "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Kastrup", "countryIsoCode": "DK", "longitude": 12.595661, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "+45 32 50 62 00 \u200e", "streetAddress": "Fugleb\u00e6kvej 2 C", "createDate": "2012-03-06 18:55:10", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Denmark", "name": "DENMARK", "isoThree": "DNK", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 208, "isoCode": "DK"}, "postalCode": "2770", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "8tHhXL", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "updateDate": "2012-03-21 19:06:20", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LOKnrY/upload_6MBK5R-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LOKnrY/upload_6MBK5R-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LOKnrY/upload_6MBK5R-icon.png"}, "id": "LOKnrY", "name": "Amager Bryghus"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.036", "description": "English Summer Ale is light straw to golden colored with medium-low to medium bitterness, light to medium-light body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness.
