Funk Metal is an 8.2% alcohol, unfiltered, unpasteurized, naturally conditioned imperial stout fermented with farmhouse yeast, aged for months in oak barrels with wild yeast and souring bacteria, and then hand-blended with other barrel-aged beer to round out the palate. The finished beer retains aromas of chocolate and roast but takes on a distinct vinous character and sour complexity from extended aging and fermentation in oak barrels.\r\n\r\nA very small number of kegs and casks of Funk Metal have already made appearances in Texas over the last few months, as well as at the Borefts Beer Festival in The Netherlands. However, the vast majority of Funk Metal was conditioned in 750ml bottles, which will be distributed throughout Texas over the next few weeks. A very small number of cases will also be distributed in select out of state markets.\r\n\r\nFunk Metal is presently a limited release beer from Jester King with only a little over 200 cases (750ml x12) available. It takes quite a long time to make (about eight months) and also requires a lot of space for oak aging.

The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).

Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became \u0003a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the \u0003facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great \u0003city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we\u2019re open.

Fermentation went very well and the beer finished out in about 3 days, also at a lower F.G. than expected. As a result the alcohol was indeed higher than expected, in fact the lab results just came in and our Brown Ale is 5.5% ABV.

Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "id": 132, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer"}, "updateDate": "2014-10-17 17:12:24", "abv": "8.9", "styleId": 132, "id": "xv9fS8", "name": "FV13"}], "numberOfPages": 683}
