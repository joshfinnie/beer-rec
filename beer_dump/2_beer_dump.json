This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties).

Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.

The North Davidson (NoDa) neighborhood is known as the creative center of Charlotte: as a natural extension of NoDa\u2019s artistic spirit, there isn\u2019t a better place for a microbrewery to call home.\r\n\r\nNoDa Brewing is a 15 barrel brewery creating the highest quality beers for local restaurants and pubs, as well as our tap room.  Our beer styles will have a Northwestern feel, showcasing American Pale Ales, India Pale Ales, and Porters.  Our small size gives us the flexibility to introduce many unique and artistic recipes as well as our renditions of classic varieties such as Imperial Stouts, Wit beers, and Winter Warmers.  Our Head Brewer frequently traveled to Europe over the past couple years.  He has been fortunate to have experienced the wonderful beers that have historically defined many current craft beer styles.  As we pay homage to these great and historic beers, we\u2019ll add an American Flair that will be embraced in the Carolinas and beyond.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:03", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday - 4 - 8:30\r\nTuesday - 4-8:30\r\nWednesday - 4-9\r\nThursday- 4-8:30\r\nFriday - 4-9:30\r\nSaturday - 12-10\r\nSunday - 1-6", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Charlotte", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:03", "id": "oGBBGF", "streetAddress": "2229 North Davidson St", "postalCode": "28205", "website": "http://www.nodabrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2011", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(704) 900-6851", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.240347, "locationType": "micro", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -80.814842, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-05-04 02:30:17", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pcrctk/upload_B1Dsle-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pcrctk/upload_B1Dsle-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pcrctk/upload_B1Dsle-icon.png"}, "id": "pcrctk", "name": "NoDa Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:57", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "AGRvvY", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Windsor", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:57", "streetAddress": "336 Ruth Carney Drive", "postalCode": "05089", "website": "http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1986", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "802-674-5491", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 43.5130201, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Vermont", "longitude": -72.4016913, "updateDate": "2014-10-06 15:45:55", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "9aSjFg", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Boston", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "306 Northern Avenue", "postalCode": "02210", "website": "http://www.harpoonbrewery.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1986", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-888-HARPOON", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Boston", "latitude": 42.3465, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Massachusetts", "longitude": -71.033843, "updateDate": "2014-09-26 14:01:43", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-11 23:35:46", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RzvedX/upload_6ztnSI-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RzvedX/upload_6ztnSI-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RzvedX/upload_6ztnSI-icon.png"}, "id": "RzvedX", "name": "Harpoon Brewery"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.036", "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "10", "categoryId": 11, "srmMax": "10", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "3.5", "fgMin": "1.006", "fgMax": "1.018", "abvMax": "5.5", "id": 112, "srmMin": "4", "name": "Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast"}, "id": "NiPIhq", "updateDate": "2014-10-20 19:10:39", "abv": "6.8", "styleId": 112, "availableId": 2, "ibu": "21", "name": "100 Barrel Series #41 Catamount Maple Wheat"}], "numberOfPages": 683}
