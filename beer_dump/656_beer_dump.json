Unlike others that brew \u201cPale Ale Style\u201d  Our beer is brewed on an Authentic British Pale Ale Brew House using the finest English Pale Ale Malt, American Hops and Yeast.  I have been brewing American Pale Ales since 1982, back in the days when I brewed 20 Liters at a time as a homebrewer.  Today I brew 2000 Liters at a time (more friends then back then).  I grew up in Northern California during the Microbrewery Revolution and you will taste that in my beers. Of course I never pasteurize our beers or add anything artificial.  Trust me when I say, Beer coming from Pf\u00e4ffikon to your dinner table will taste fresher than beer brought in a container traveling 2 months over the ocean.  Don\u2019t just take our word for it, Biergenuss Magazine calls us \u201cThe Rothschild of Beer\u201d. Thanks to all of you for making Western Rider the number one selling Pale Ale in Switzerland. Unlike many other brands, we are not brewed in Germany or in another Kanton and then sold as a \u201cLocal\u201d or \u201cSwiss Beer\u201d. We are also not a big beer factory, owned by a European neighbor.  With every Sudwerk Beer, you are enjoying an Authentic Pale Ale produced here in Switzerland, by a family owned and operated \u201cKleinbrauerei\u201d/Microbrewery. With every Sudwerk Beer, you enjoy the true meaning of Swiss Quality and the results of good old fashioned hard work.  You can find us in larger COOP Stores in the German and French speaking parts of Switzerland, on the Bahnhofstrasse in Jelmoli, Rio Getr\u00e4nke, Drinks of the World as well as in over 100 Restaurants and Hotels. In Z\u00fcrich, we are distributed by Heineken Distribution, Intercomestibles AG and Schatt Getr\u00e4nke. Quality without compromise. If you are ever in the neighborhood, come by and visit us!

In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.\r\n\r\nOwners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.struisebrouwers.be/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Woesten", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "West-Vlaanderen", "countryIsoCode": "BE", "longitude": 2.7831, "country": {"displayName": "Belgium", "name": "BELGIUM", "isoThree": "BEL", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 56, "isoCode": "BE"}, "isClosed": "N", "streetAddress": "Woesten", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2001", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "latitude": 50.900311, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "qcAp7N", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-10-30 11:30:48", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_rK0nnu-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_rK0nnu-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_rK0nnu-icon.png"}, "id": "bjwFtZ", "name": "De Struise"}], "name": "Westoek XX", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:44:29", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/gy7L3g/upload_2W0Prc-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/gy7L3g/upload_2W0Prc-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/gy7L3g/upload_2W0Prc-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.07", "description": "Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

This just goes to show how a hugely flavorful IPA can be loaded-up with fresh ingredients and come out the other end, a tasty LOW octane, treat!
