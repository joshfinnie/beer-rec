Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars.

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "25", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "6.2", "fgMin": "1.016", "fgMax": "1.028", "abvMax": "8", "id": 15, "srmMin": "15", "name": "Scotch Ale"}, "updateDate": "2012-10-24 11:40:25", "abv": "7.1", "styleId": 15, "id": "gcsCV5", "name": "Oak Aged Bourbon Scotch Ale"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.farmhousebeer.com/", "established": "2011", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Small farm brewery located in the upper Hood River Valley, OR.\r\n\r\nWe strive to create unique and intriguing beer.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "id": 132, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer"}, "updateDate": "2014-01-02 18:56:03", "abv": "11.8", "styleId": 132, "availableId": 3, "id": "elfZCu", "name": "Oak Aged Pilot Project"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Belgian-Style Stout with French Oak.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-11-09 01:31:36", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.twinleafbrewery.com", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Twin Leaf Brewery", "createDate": "2012-11-02 14:32:36", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "yJ1zJK", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Asheville", "createDate": "2012-11-02 14:33:28", "streetAddress": "144 Coxe Avenue", "latitude": 35.5894369, "website": "http://www.twinleafbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2014", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "28801", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewpub", "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -82.554528, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "updateDate": "2012-11-02 14:35:11", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s5lxSd/upload_cr3g0w-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s5lxSd/upload_cr3g0w-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s5lxSd/upload_cr3g0w-icon.png"}, "id": "s5lxSd", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "description": "Recognizing the uniqueness and traditions of several other styles of Belgian Ales, the beers entered in this category will be assessed on the merits that they do not fit existing style guidelines and information that the brewer provides explaining the history and tradition of the style.

They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "id": 132, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer"}, "id": "RyUINP", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "srmId": 21, "abv": "10.31", "styleId": 132, "availableId": 4, "foodPairings": "Pairs well with flavors of the season", "ibu": "39", "srm": {"hex": "952D00", "id": 21, "name": "21"}, "glasswareId": 8}], "numberOfPages": 683}
