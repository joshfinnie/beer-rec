St. Boniface saw the unconverted Saxons worshiping Thor and knew something must be done. The humble saint took an axe to the massive Thor Oak, which was sacred to the Saxons, in order to show them that his God was mightier than theirs. With fierce and repeated blows he leveled the massive tree; those around him feared God and were converted to Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe deed of Boniface provides an elegant analogy for our own mission at Saint Boniface Craft Brewing Co. Mike and Jon have witnessed many beer \u201cpagans\u201d worshiping the false gods of the big beer industry and see that it is time to take a Boniface-like swing at converting some of those people to a better way of life, one full of rich, tasty, more satisfying brews."}], "name": "Tripel", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:44:24", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/HGq6gv/upload_BlcEl9-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/HGq6gv/upload_BlcEl9-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/HGq6gv/upload_BlcEl9-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.07", "description": "Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States.

A microbrewery was in the original plans for the business but was not feasible at the time due to the high cost of equipment and space.  The Wildflower Caf\u00e9 had enormous success, which helped the inspiration for the Crooked Rooster Brewpub\u2019s opening in 1998, again founded by Doug Thayer.  Throughout the running of these side-by-side businesses, Doug always had brewing on his mind and began to experiment in 2002 with home brewing.  Receiving excellent feedback on his brews from several beer aficionados, Roosterfish Brewing\u2019s first official beer, Black Walnut Nut Brown Ale (now known as Original Nut Brown Ale) was unveiled at the Crooked Rooster and Wildflower Caf\u00e9 in 2004.  This was shortly followed with the Butternut Pale Ale, now known as Dog Tooth Pale Ale.  The drastic name changes occurred because the originals were rejected due to \u201cimplied ingredients\u201d that weren\u2019t actually present in the beers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Sun: 11:30 am - 12:30 am", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Watkins Glen", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "id": "TxaTZN", "streetAddress": "223 - 301 North Franklin Street", "postalCode": "14891", "website": "http://www.roosterfishbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1990", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "607-535-9797", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.381121, "locationType": "micro", "region": "New York", "longitude": -76.874257, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "DE", "name": "Main Brewery", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Th\u00fcringen", "longitude": 12.0076316, "isClosed": "N", "createDate": "2012-08-12 14:45:22", "status": "deleted", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Germany", "name": "GERMANY", "isoThree": "DEU", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 276, "isoCode": "DE"}, "latitude": 50.9307183, "isPrimary": "N", "id": "yS64Yy", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Deleted"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-03-21 19:06:11", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_XoXYMd-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_XoXYMd-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_XoXYMd-icon.png"}, "id": "WQyasy", "name": "Rooster Fish Brewing"}], "name": "Tripel Witch Ale", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-10 00:08:59", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/dhLXbk/upload_MoRAdo-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/dhLXbk/upload_MoRAdo-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/dhLXbk/upload_MoRAdo-icon.png"}, "originalGravity": "1.085", "id": "dhLXbk", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 8, "name": "Tulip"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.07", "description": "Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.
