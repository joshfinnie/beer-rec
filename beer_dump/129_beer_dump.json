From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "DrFlD0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Carlsbad", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "571 Carlsbad Village Dr.", "postalCode": "92008", "website": "http://www.pizzaport.com/locations/carlsbad/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1997", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "760-720-7007", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Carlsbad", "latitude": 33.1596505, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.3478111, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Sun - Thur - 11am - 10pm\r\nFri - Sat. - 11am - Midnight", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Solana Beach", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "id": "qAyZMR", "streetAddress": "135 N.

So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment.
