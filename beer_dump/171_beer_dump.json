Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-11-18 12:30:28", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  10:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Traverse City", "createDate": "2013-11-18 12:32:00", "id": "1QFuku", "streetAddress": "2959 Hartman Rd", "postalCode": "49685", "website": "http://www.breweryterrafirma.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2013", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(231) 929-1600", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.7154521, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -85.6354376, "updateDate": "2014-09-29 20:36:47", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-11-18 12:30:28", "id": "dvuEzd", "name": "Brewery Terra Firma"}], "name": "Debauchery", "createDate": "2013-11-18 12:36:28", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/9tzgds/upload_93tIDt-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/9tzgds/upload_93tIDt-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/9tzgds/upload_93tIDt-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.036", "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Just great hand-crafted beer brewed in West London with the best ingredients, knowledge, and respect for process, and a little insanity.\r\n\r\nBut why stop there? We don\u2019t believe in being stereotyped. We love upfront in-your-face hop focused beers, but are we only going to brew these? Hell no! We love beer, and we will brew whatever we want, whenever it suits us.\r\n\r\nAt Weird Beard we aim to continue making experimental, no-holds-barred beers that we feel excited about and we want to drink.\r\n\r\nInspired by the American and burgeoning British craft beer movement, along with great music, exquisite food, epic beards, and the outstanding beer community in our hometown of London, Weird Beard Brew Co will not compromise on anything to bring the best flavours to the beer, whether it is the roasted specialty grains in a stout or the newest hops in an IPA. We create beers that push the boundaries of style, forcing the consumer to stop and think about the drink in front of them, to confront the misconceptions of what ale and beer should or can be, and who drinks it? \r\n\r\nAnd before you ask, yes, Gregg and Bryan do sport some very impressive facial hair. Here at Weird Beard Brew Co we are all about the beards, but not so much the sandals. We are passionate about good beer, no matter where it comes from or how it is dispensed. You will find us in bottle shops, on cask in real ale pubs and in the best London beer bars on keg.\r\n\r\nWeird Beard Brew Co is a full on, no compromise brewery, brewing great tasting and genre-busting beers...hold on to your taste buds and come along for the ride!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-11-10 17:37:14", "locations": [{"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "p0vg5z", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Hanwell", "createDate": "2014-11-10 17:59:01", "streetAddress": "Boston Business Park", "postalCode": "W72QA", "extendedAddress": "Unit 5", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "phone": "0203 645 2711", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 51.5000484, "locationType": "micro", "region": "London", "longitude": -0.338234, "updateDate": "2014-11-10 17:59:01", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}}], "updateDate": "2014-11-10 17:53:57", "id": "RWa0Ki", "name": "Weird Beard Brew Co."}], "originalGravity": "1.062", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.08", "description": "See British Origin American-Style Imperial Porter Imperial porters are very dark brown to black in color.

After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm.

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm.

They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen.
