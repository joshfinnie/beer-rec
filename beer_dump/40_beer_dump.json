Beginning in 2010, ADBW will be released in late SEP.\r\n\r\nIn its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table.\r\n\r\nEach annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment.\r\n\r\nMidnight Sun's elusive Arctic Devil Barley Wine is Alaska's most awarded barley wine.", "name": "Arctic Devil Barley Wine 2010", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:43", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/qeYTCJ/upload_L0RRus-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/qeYTCJ/upload_L0RRus-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/qeYTCJ/upload_L0RRus-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.09", "description": "American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.
