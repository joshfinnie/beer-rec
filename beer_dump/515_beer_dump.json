Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence.

The beer celebrates the Rogue Creamery\u2019s 75th Anniversary (1935-2010) and will be paired at SAVOR with Rogue Farms Freedom Cheddar cheese, a cow\u2019s milk cheddar cheese hand-mixed with Freedom hops from the Chatoe Rogue Micro Hopyard in Oregon\u2019s Wigrich Appellation.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "10", "categoryId": 4, "srmMax": "9", "ibuMax": "15", "abvMin": "4.4", "fgMin": "1.008", "fgMax": "1.012", "abvMax": "5.4", "id": 47, "srmMin": "3", "name": "Leipzig-Style Gose"}, "id": "ecKf2z", "updateDate": "2014-09-25 18:21:51", "abv": "5.2", "styleId": 47, "ibu": "12", "name": "Roll in Ze' Hay"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-08-12 12:06:41", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.rollberger.de/", "established": "2009", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Privatbrauerei am Rollberg", "createDate": "2012-08-07 10:17:35", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "DE", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Berlin", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Berlin", "longitude": 13.43303, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 52.477489, "streetAddress": "Werbellinstra\u00dfe 50", "createDate": "2012-08-12 14:47:13", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Germany", "name": "GERMANY", "isoThree": "DEU", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 276, "isoCode": "DE"}, "postalCode": "12053", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "bOSrnv", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-08-13 02:13:16", "id": "FjBiTY", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "updateDate": "2012-08-17 17:37:29", "id": "J68ses", "name": "Rollberger Rollberger Helles"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-08-12 12:06:42", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.rollberger.de/", "established": "2009", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Privatbrauerei am Rollberg", "createDate": "2012-08-07 10:17:35", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "DE", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Berlin", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Berlin", "longitude": 13.43303, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 52.477489, "streetAddress": "Werbellinstra\u00dfe 50", "createDate": "2012-08-12 14:47:13", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Germany", "name": "GERMANY", "isoThree": "DEU", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 276, "isoCode": "DE"}, "postalCode": "12053", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "bOSrnv", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-08-13 02:13:16", "id": "FjBiTY", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "updateDate": "2012-08-17 17:37:30", "id": "vPrgoJ", "name": "Rollberger Rollberger Rotes"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available during the summer months.", "id": 6, "name": "Summer"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.newbelgium.com/", "established": "1989", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "We'll set the scene: 1989.
