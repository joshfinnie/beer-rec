The beer tells us when it\u2019s ready. We refuse to be a slave to production deadlines.  Wheat Ridge Colorado is a relaxed community just west of Denver with easy access from I-70. Wheat Ridge was one of the few remaining enclaves along the Front Range without a microbrewery. This changed in November 2012!  We are dedicated to providing our local neighborhood with a place to relax and have a pint close to home.\r\n\r\nOur Brew master, Rick Abitbol has been professionally brewing award winning beers along the Front Range for over a decade.  Rick is respectful of beer styles and traditional brewing technique.  And has long been an innovator of style and not afraid to color outside the lines. He was one of the first brewers to explore the Black IPA which has since come to be regarded as a new style in judging guidelines.   We love hops! That\u2019s not to say you won\u2019t find any wonderfully malty creations on tap there are many, but what you will notice is the variety in our hoppy selections.  Be on the lookout for Rick\u2019s special brews!\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re Talking Much Better Beer!  We are pleased to feature a great selection of Gluten Reduced Beer.  All Rickoli\u2019s brews that do not contain wheat are considered gluten reduced.

Brewing Company, 'Gusto' is part of everything we do. Our hand-crafted beers reflect our passion for the brewer's art and our commitment to creating beers that excite and delight the quaffer's palette.\r\nQuaff ON! Brewing Company was formed in 2012 in response to the demand for the iconic craft beers we developed at Big Woods Brewing Company, our brewpub located in the heart of Brown County Indiana. Why 'Quaff ON!'? Because from the day Big Woods threw open its doors in 2009, Quaff ON! has been the rallying cry, the toast, and the salutation of our loyal fans.\r\nWhen Big Woods founders Jeff McCabe, Tim O'Bryan and Ed Ryan decided to create Quaff ON! Brewing Company, they had one Master Brewer in mind to take Busted Knuckle Ale, Hare Trigger IPA, Six Foot Blonde and Timid Virgin Pale to new heights and a larger market. That Brewer is Mark Havens, whose reputation as a talented and committed 'creator of craft beers' is well known. Mark came on board in time to lend a hand in the conversion of our 60 year old bowling alley into the Quaff ON! brewing facility.\r\nOnce Mark got the new brewery up and running and our original Big Woods recipes were in production, Mark began introducing new beers, including Yellow Dwarf Wheat, a hopped up wheat that begs to be quaffed and Sadie the Goat Brown Ale, a hearty homage to the substantial beers quaffed by river pirates 2 centuries ago.\r\nCurrently Quaff ON!'s beers are distributed all over Indiana. Look for us at your favorite watering hole and in the craft beer section at package stores throughout the state. If Quaff ON! is not served at your favorite place, send us a note and we'll get it in there! If you're travelling our way, stop in and see us in Brown County and visit us in Nashville at Big Woods Village where you can enjoy fine craft beer, great food and the best in local entertainment.\r\n\r\n\"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.\" - William Shakespeare", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Thur: 11:30am - 9pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30am - 10pm\r\nSun: 11:30am - 9pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Nashville", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "id": "qZJOHj", "streetAddress": "60 Molly Ln", "postalCode": "47448", "website": "http://www.bigwoodsbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "813-988-6000", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.2079575, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -86.2484171, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-09-29 14:27:49", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_4Y9OeY-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_4Y9OeY-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_4Y9OeY-icon.png"}, "id": "f8oZ5j", "name": "Quaff On!

So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment.
