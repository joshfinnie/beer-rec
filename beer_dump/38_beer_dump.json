Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Sunday - Thursday: 12-8\r\nFriday and Saturday: 12-10", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Sawyer", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "id": "AlhRYb", "streetAddress": "5885 Sawyer Rd.", "postalCode": "49125", "website": "http://www.greenbushbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "269-405-1076", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.8856286, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -86.5946671, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "updateDate": "2012-04-09 18:18:49", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QJRQhZ/upload_999gvA-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QJRQhZ/upload_999gvA-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QJRQhZ/upload_999gvA-icon.png"}, "id": "QJRQhZ", "name": "Greenbush Brewing Co"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.038", "description": "Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.

After visting breweries around the world, Steven noticed a lack of crisp refreshing session style beers brewed here in the US, so in 2010, the seeds of Low Brau were planted. \r\n\r\nWith a background in the food industry and many years of beer research, it was only natural for Steven to start brewing at home, and wasn't long before he started creating his own recipes. Now a year later, Low Brau continues to move forward, with plans to open it's doors within the District in the next year. \r\n\r\nLow Brau's beers are German inspired, following the guidelines set fourth by the Rheinheitsgebot Purity Law and high quality ingredients. Each beer is hand crafted and brewed in small batches to maintain quality over quantity. \r\n\r\nLow Brau strongly believes in \"Embracing Simplicity\".", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:01", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.lowbraudc.com/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Washington", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "District of Columbia", "countryIsoCode": "US", "longitude": -77.031959, "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "isClosed": "N", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:01", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2010", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "latitude": 38.89037, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "YglaK6", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-05-17 13:44:58", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3UbArS/upload_EudZdI-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3UbArS/upload_EudZdI-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3UbArS/upload_EudZdI-icon.png"}, "id": "3UbArS", "name": "Low Brau"}], "updateDate": "2012-03-22 13:05:45", "availableId": 4, "id": "Kz2PQq", "name": "Apfelwein"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.highwaterbrewing.com/", "established": "2011", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Leveraging his successful 15 year brewing career, Brewmaster Steve Altimari has partnered with John Anthony, another seasoned veteran of the craft brewing industry, to start their own California Bay Area venture, High Water Brewing.\r\n\r\nInspired by the most creative brewing practices and styles across the world, Steve and John's love of beer and unbridled passion for all things flavorful have led to a line of products that represent the very best of the best.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility.
