By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:50", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:50", "id": "qo6LCf", "streetAddress": "1621 Moore St.", "postalCode": "45202", "website": "http://www.christianmoerlein.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1853", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-827-6025", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery, General Offices and Taproom", "latitude": 39.1137948, "locationType": "production", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5150108, "updateDate": "2014-07-27 12:11:20", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nTue:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nThu:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2012-08-02 18:10:31", "id": "X0HMO8", "streetAddress": "115 Joe Nuxhall Way", "postalCode": "45202", "website": "http://www.moerleinlagerhouse.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2012", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-421-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Christian Moerlein Lager House", "latitude": 39.0963619, "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5087017, "updateDate": "2014-07-27 12:10:27", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-27 12:12:28", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-icon.png"}, "id": "Em1uno", "name": "Christian Moerlein Brewing Company"}], "description": "A robust Doppelbock brewed to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the repeal of prohibition.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal.

was founded in Cincinnati, Ohio's Over-the-Rhine Brewery District in 1853 by its German immigrant namesake Mr. Christian Moerlein. By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:50", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:50", "id": "qo6LCf", "streetAddress": "1621 Moore St.", "postalCode": "45202", "website": "http://www.christianmoerlein.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1853", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-827-6025", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery, General Offices and Taproom", "latitude": 39.1137948, "locationType": "production", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5150108, "updateDate": "2014-07-27 12:11:20", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nTue:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nThu:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2012-08-02 18:10:31", "id": "X0HMO8", "streetAddress": "115 Joe Nuxhall Way", "postalCode": "45202", "website": "http://www.moerleinlagerhouse.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2012", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-421-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Christian Moerlein Lager House", "latitude": 39.0963619, "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5087017, "updateDate": "2014-07-27 12:10:27", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-27 12:12:28", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-icon.png"}, "id": "Em1uno", "name": "Christian Moerlein Brewing Company"}, {"website": "http://mtcarmelbrewingcompany.com/", "established": "2005", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Mt.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties).

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.
