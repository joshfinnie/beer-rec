All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

We currently brew over 20 beers for distribution as well as many other small batch beers that are served at our pub in Kalamazoo, the Eccentric Cafe. Our ongoing goal is to brew thoughtfully, creatively and artistically. We strive to bring an authentic and pleasant experience to all of our customers through our unique ales and beers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "NnffJ2", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Galesburg", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "streetAddress": "8938 Krum Ave.", "postalCode": "49053", "website": "http://www.bellsbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1985", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "269-382-2338", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.2843486, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -85.4538497, "updateDate": "2014-09-25 20:15:04", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 2:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am\n\nOur kitchen closes daily at 9 p.m.", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Kalamazoo", "createDate": "2013-09-26 11:44:59", "id": "uCUre7", "streetAddress": "355 E Kalamazoo Ave", "latitude": 42.2949613, "website": "http://bellsbeer.com/eccentric-cafe/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1993", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "49007", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Bell's Eccentric Cafe", "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -85.5789817, "updateDate": "2014-09-25 20:21:54", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon.-Wed.: 11 a.m.-12 a.m.\nThu.-Sat.: 11 a.m.-2 a.m.\nSun.: Noon-12 a.m.", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Kalamazoo", "createDate": "2014-07-25 18:11:58", "id": "Y0IatW", "streetAddress": "355 E.

It\u2019s not just because of the award-winning fine ales and great food served up by the Rubicon. Within the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts. It\u2019s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis pub is part of the community, and I don\u2019t just mean geographically,\u201d said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation. I really feel like we\u2019re connected with the people and that they can trust that they\u2019ll feel at home here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrewmaster Scott Cramlet has felt so at home that he\u2019s stayed more than two decades. In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we\u2019re very happy with things right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I\u2019m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I\u2019ve been at the Rubicon, and I hear people say, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s impressive.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown\u2019s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry \u2013 first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur \u2013 Phillips kept in close contact with Brown. Buoyed by his management experience at Marin Brewing, Phillips was confident that he could handle the passing of the baton at the Rubicon.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11am to 10pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Sacramento", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "id": "N39Q0L", "streetAddress": "2004 Capitol Avenue", "postalCode": "95814", "website": "http://www.rubiconbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1987", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "916-448-7032", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 38.573116, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -121.480958, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-03-21 19:06:08", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iBzEfC/upload_9rcK7S-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iBzEfC/upload_9rcK7S-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iBzEfC/upload_9rcK7S-icon.png"}, "id": "iBzEfC", "name": "Rubicon Brewing Company"}], "name": "25th Anniversary Ale", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-04-15 00:56:23", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Cxe8y3/upload_3VGpne-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Cxe8y3/upload_3VGpne-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Cxe8y3/upload_3VGpne-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
