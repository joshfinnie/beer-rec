The monks had brewed beer for their own use since 1634. The beer that was permitted to be sold on holidays was a Bock style which gained local fame. After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the Gebr\u00fcder Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas Br\u00e4u. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz. A daughter company is the Auer Br\u00e4u AG Rosenheim. Paulaner belongs to the BHI (Brau Holding International AG), a joint venture between Sch\u00f6rghuber Ventures (50.1%) and with Holland's Heineken N.V.
