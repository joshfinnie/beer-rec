Thank you for embracing our fiercely independent vision of a hand-crafted future for all! Operating as a brewpub from August 1995 until February 2005, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company recently relocated to our current location in the West End of downtown Cincinnati. We officially reopened with a completed expansion plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals 31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently flavorful product. While our brewing process is quite labor intensive, we believe that hand-crafting our beers sets us apart from the majority of breweries in the U.S. today.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.

Hops include classic varieties, including Cascade, Nugget and Willamette, with modern varieties Apollo and Zythos reflecting a nod to the future. ESB, Crystal 40, Special Aromatic, Wheat, Carahell, and Sour malts. Dryhopped and ran through several pounds of whole leaf Cascade in our hopback, Eagle Harbor presents a firm hop aroma, supported by enough malt character to keep you coming back for more.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY: As the story goes, India Pale Ale was a big, hoppy beer designed to survive passage in a ship's hold all the way to India. Eagle Harbor is the bay that Downtown Winslow adjoins and the location of the ferry terminal. Interestingly, Winslow was not the main settlement on the island for much of its history. Searching for a new harbor to build ever larger ships, in 1903 the Hall Brothers Shipyard relocated from Port Blakely to Eagle Harbor. The tiny settlement of Madrone was then renamed Winslow, after the deceased Winslow Hall. Eagle Harbor IPA is named for that fading dream of enormous five-masted schooners, sailing to distant shores.", "name": "Eagle Harbor IPA", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2012-09-15 13:20:11", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.bainbridgebeer.com/", "established": "2012", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Making a great beer requires a combination of art and science.

Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not.

Eel River Brewing wants to show their commitment to sustainability and encourage others to do so by producing a sustainable, organic beer that promotes Earth Day and supports a like-minded non-profit.\r\n\r\nEarth Thirst, a Double IPA, will be brewed with over 3 pounds of hops per barrel throughout the brewing process, giving it a fresh and intense aroma. When it comes to Double IPAs, Head Brewer Mike Smith says that \u201cit\u2019s all about hop flavor and aroma from the dry hops. The flavor depends on the hops that you use. Since this beer uses Cascade and Centennial hops, it has a heavy floral aroma and citrus flavor.\u201d What makes this Double IPA unique is that it uses the highest quality, all organic ingredients - all from the Pacific Northwest. According to Smith, \u201cThe more locally produced ingredients are the more fresh they are when we get them, allowing the flavors to come out more.\u201d Earth Thirst is not only 100% organic, but 100% sustainable also as Eel River Brewing is 100% bio-mass powered. Eel River Brewing will begin shipping out their Earth Thirst beer at the end of March with only limited quantities available since Earth Thirst is a specialty release. To help promote organics and sustainability, a portion of the proceeds of Earth Thirst will be donated to CCOF.\r\n\r\nEel River Brewing chose to work with CCOF due to their practices and beliefs. CCOF is the only full-service organic certification agency and trade association that provides benefits on behalf of it members. CCOF certifies over 2,400 clients in the US, Mexico and Canada and its members and clients receive full trade association benefits, which include advocacy, education, marketing support and networking opportunities for the organic community (CCOF.org). Robin Boyle, Director of Marketing, Member Services and Development for CCOF, described the importance of CCOF and Eel River Brewing working together: \u201cWe are very excited to celebrate Earth Day with the first certified organic brewery.
