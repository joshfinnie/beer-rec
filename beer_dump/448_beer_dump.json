All of our beers are brewed with the intention of creating something we'll enjoy drinking ourselves and, more importantly, something we're proud to put our name to. In a world of endless possibilities, we try to explore as many of them as possible, which is why to date we've brewed in excess of two hundred different beers: some of them regulars, the odd few occasionals, and far too many one-offs to remember let alone try to name!\r\nYou should be able to find our beers on offer nationwide in the kind of pubs and bars that have the freedom and willingness to stock good beer. While most of it goes into cask, you'll also find it in keg or bottle if you look in the right places.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-05-08 08:41:02", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Lawrence Hill", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "production", "region": "Bristol", "longitude": -2.5694249, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 51.4583567, "streetAddress": "Unit 4 Lawrence Hill Industrial Park", "createDate": "2013-05-09 00:37:54", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}, "postalCode": "BS5 0EB", "extendedAddress": "Croydon Street", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "pguslr", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nTue:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 10:30pm\n\nMon-Thu 4pm-11pm;\r\nFri 4pm-12am;\r\nSat 12pm-12am;\r\nSun 12pm-10:30pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Tasting Room", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bristol", "createDate": "2013-05-09 00:40:12", "id": "S0dgvI", "streetAddress": "147 Church Rd", "postalCode": "BS5 9LA", "extendedAddress": "Redfield", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "phone": "0117 939 4079", "isClosed": "N", "name": "The Old Stillage", "latitude": 51.4586634, "locationType": "tasting", "longitude": -2.5581766, "updateDate": "2014-08-25 19:12:59", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}}, {"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nTue:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nWed:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nThu:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  4:00pm - 10:30pm\n\nMon-Thu 12pm-2.30pm & 4pm-11pm;\r\nFri-Sat 12pm-12am;\r\nSun 4pm-10:30pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bristol", "createDate": "2013-05-09 00:41:57", "id": "4KMV4j", "streetAddress": "78 Saint George's Road", "postalCode": "BS1 5UR", "extendedAddress": "Hotwells", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "phone": "0117 907 0689", "isClosed": "N", "name": "The Three Tuns", "latitude": 51.4511176, "locationType": "restaurant", "longitude": -2.6049702, "updateDate": "2014-08-25 19:13:00", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-05-09 00:46:29", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3CT0MA/upload_TQKReY-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3CT0MA/upload_TQKReY-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3CT0MA/upload_TQKReY-icon.png"}, "id": "3CT0MA", "name": "Arbor Ales"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel.
