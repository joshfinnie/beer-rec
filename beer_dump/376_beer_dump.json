Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:11", "mailingListUrl": "http://www.troegs.com/about_us/newsletter.aspx", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Sun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\nGeneral Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Hershey", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:11", "id": "C6iHOv", "streetAddress": "200 E Hersheypark Dr", "postalCode": "17033", "website": "http://www.troegs.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1997", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "717-232-1297", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 40.2972852, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -76.6428527, "updateDate": "2014-10-02 18:04:49", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-10-02 15:58:31", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_3yONkx-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_3yONkx-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_3yONkx-icon.png"}, "id": "n5QFi2", "name": "Tr\u00f6egs Brewing Company"}], "srm": {"hex": "821E00", "id": 24, "name": "24"}, "servingTemperature": "cool", "updateDate": "2014-11-11 22:14:20", "ibu": "15"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.puritybrewing.com/", "established": "2005", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "One of the fastest growing craft breweries in the UK, producing three award-winning beers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-03-22 22:33:32", "mailingListUrl": "http://www.puritybrewing.com/", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "9 - 5 weekdays\r\n10 - 1 Saturdays\r\nClosed on Sundays", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Great Alne", "createDate": "2013-03-22 22:35:54", "id": "teNvBQ", "streetAddress": "Upper Spernall Farm", "postalCode": "B49 6JF", "extendedAddress": "Off Spernal Lane", "website": "http://www.puritybrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2005", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "phone": "01789 488007", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 52.2417579, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Warwickshire", "longitude": -1.8440071, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-09-09 22:19:16", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fCroxq/upload_bjuUbQ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fCroxq/upload_bjuUbQ-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fCroxq/upload_bjuUbQ-icon.png"}, "id": "fCroxq", "name": "Purity Brewing Co"}], "description": "A zesty pale ale with a smooth and citrusy finish.
