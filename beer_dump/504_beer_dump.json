Thank you for embracing our fiercely independent vision of a hand-crafted future for all! Operating as a brewpub from August 1995 until February 2005, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company recently relocated to our current location in the West End of downtown Cincinnati. We officially reopened with a completed expansion plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals 31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently flavorful product.

Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its\r\nFlagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop,\r\nand R&D Series.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:03", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "KzHweV", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Eugene", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:03", "streetAddress": "272 Van Buren St", "postalCode": "97402", "website": "http://www.ninkasibrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2006", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "877-7-NINKASI", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.056855, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Oregon", "longitude": -123.10988, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-11-01 11:44:26", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-icon.png"}, "id": "V4I9FT", "name": "Ninkasi Brewing Company"}], "name": "Redunkulous", "createDate": "2012-11-01 11:16:09", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pn6FVF/upload_tzBzQS-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pn6FVF/upload_tzBzQS-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pn6FVF/upload_tzBzQS-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 4, "name": "German Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.048", "description": "This beer style is characterized by a distinct sweet maltiness and a chocolate-like character from roasted malt.

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "25", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "6.2", "fgMin": "1.016", "fgMax": "1.028", "abvMax": "8", "id": 15, "srmMin": "15", "name": "Scotch Ale"}, "id": "OtqyrC", "updateDate": "2014-09-12 15:27:01", "abv": "10.5", "styleId": 15, "ibu": "31", "name": "Regimental Reserve"}], "numberOfPages": 683}
