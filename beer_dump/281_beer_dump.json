A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity.

These ales have a medium hop bitterness and flavor. They often don't have hop aroma. Irish-style red ales have low to medium candy-like caramel malt sweetness and may have a balanced subtle degree of roast barley or roast malt character and complexity.  Irish-style Red Ales have a medium body. The style may have low levels of fruity-ester flavor and aroma. Diacetyl should be absent or at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Slight yeast haze is acceptable for bottle-conditioned products.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "20", "categoryId": 2, "srmMax": "18", "ibuMax": "28", "abvMin": "4", "fgMin": "1.01", "fgMax": "1.014", "abvMax": "4.5", "id": 22, "srmMin": "11", "name": "Irish-Style Red Ale"}, "id": "9B938M", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "updateDate": "2014-02-11 23:59:45", "abv": "4", "styleId": 22, "srm": {"hex": "600903", "id": 30, "name": "30"}, "ibu": "21", "name": "Heron's Craic"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.liquidhero.com/", "established": "2011", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Liquid Hero Brewing Company", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:00", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.liquidhero.com/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "York", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Pennsylvania", "countryIsoCode": "US", "longitude": -76.728344, "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "isClosed": "N", "streetAddress": "E.
