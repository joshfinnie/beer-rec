In fact we\u2019ve had it figured out for years.  We both had our hearts set on brewing the sort of beer we loved so much in Yorkshire.\r\nMany people know that Martha and I love Theakston\u2019s Old Peculier, at least the cask version.  But Robinson\u2019s Old Tom is high on our list as well.  Now that Samuel Smith has released Yorkshire Stingo that makes three.  At the brewery where I worked in Yorkshire we made a unique beer called \u201cMorocco Ale\u201d  that is quite similar as well.\r\n\r\nObviously PRETTY THINGS isn\u2019t all about simple replication.  As a rule we don\u2019t do beer \u201cstyles\u201d straight up, as it doesn\u2019t leave any room for creativity.  Instead we take our inspiration from great beers as a starting point.\r\n\r\n\u201cRustic Dark Ale\u201d, is about as apt a descriptor as we could come up with for Saint Botolph\u2019s Town (we almost used \u201cNew World Stingo\u201d but decided to save that for a future beer).  This ale is formulated with the malts of Thomas Fawcett & Sons of Yorkshire, England as its base.  When I was brewing in Yorkshire I visited this magnificent maltings many times, seeing crystal and roasted malts still made by hand. On brew day their crystal malt gave an amazing golden raisin-like aroma in the kettle.  Fantastic!\r\n\r\nAs we did in Jack D\u2019Or, we used a small amount of Malted Oats, but cut it this time with Torrefied Wheat.  We \u201cchaptalized\u201d using four different types of sugar in very small doses for both flavour AND colour.\r\n\r\nSBT is fermented with two yeast strains for a unique rustic finish.  But it\u2019s in the yeast strains where this beer really departs from the typical: one is a German ale strain, the other is a common English strain.  Why?  Because it\u2019s about the flavour, not just ticking the \u201cstyle\u201d boxes.\r\n\r\nIn the end we have an ale of 5.9% abv with a big malty, almost smokey Black Malt character, a bitter attack from Fuggle hops, a rich barleymalt finish, some dried coconut hints and an old ale acidity around the edges.  We\u2019ve even timed its tan head, standing proud for ten minutes!\r\n\r\nThe name \u201cSaint Botolph\u2019s Town\u201d is in tribute to our great home in America: Boston.  The original Boston in Lincolnshire, England is an abbreviation of \u201cBotolph\u2019s Town\u201d or \u201cBotolph\u2019s Stone\u201d. When we were back in Yorkshire recently, we found a churchyard where St. Botolph spoke in the year 675; a \u2018stump\u2019 (broken old cross) marks the spot.  Saint Botolph is a 7th century saint from England whose feast day is June 17th.

The production of Gueuze Saint Louis booms to a record in that time of 1 million kg of malt.\r\nIn 1980 Luc responds to the growing demand for heavy blond beers and launches Brigand, named after the farmer\u2019s uprising against French occupation in 1798.\r\nIn 1986 the family buys Ingelmunster castle and 3 years later, the famous Kasteel(bier) is launched.

Dry stouts achieve a dry-roasted character through the use of roasted barley. The emphasis of coffee-like roasted barley and a moderate degree of roasted malt aromas define much of the character. Some slight acidity may be perceived but is not necessary. European hop aroma and flavor should be low or not perceived. Dry stouts have medium-light to medium body. Fruity esters are minimal and overshadowed by malt, high hop bitterness, and roasted barley character. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be very low or not perceived. Head retention and rich character should be part of its visual character.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "30", "categoryId": 2, "srmMax": "40", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "3.8",
