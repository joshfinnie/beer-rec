The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school.

The two dreamed of starting a Brewpub that offered many varieties of house-brewed ales and lagers and hearty made-from-scratch pub fare to accompany the beers. The original Downtown location opened in November 1994 and expanded with the addition of a pool hall in 1996. The wild success of the first Great Dane led to the decision to open more pubs in the Madison area.\r\n\r\nThe Fitchburg Great Dane began operations in 2002 and the Hilldale pub followed in 2006. In 2009, the Hilldale pub expanded its brewery and opened a 4,000 square foot pool hall. Additionally, in May of 2009, the first Great Dane outside of the Madison area debuted in Wausau, Wisconsin. The Wausau Great Dane added a 100 seat beer garden and outdoor bar in the spring of 2011. In November 2010, the fifth Great Dane began operations in Grandview commons, off of Cottage Grove Road on Madison's east side.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "mailingListUrl": "http://www.greatdanepub.com/email-list-signup", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday- Thursday 11AM-2AM, Friday-Saturday 11AM-230AM, Sunday 10AM-2AM", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Fitchburg", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "id": "IdIInN", "streetAddress": "2980 Cahill Main", "postalCode": "53711", "website": "http://fitchburg.greatdanepub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "608-442-9000", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Fitchburg", "latitude": 43.0177229, "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -89.423194, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday - Thursday 11AM-2AM,Friday 11AM-2:30AM, Saturday 10AM-2:30AM on Farmer's Market and Home Football Saturdays,11AM-2:30AM other Saturdays, Sunday 10AM-2AM", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Madison", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "id": "ux16wo", "streetAddress": "123 E.
