Curiosity eventually got the best of us, and we combined the two - our first batch of homebrew was conceived in the early 90's with home brewing equipment, books, and some ingredients handed down from our parent's home brewing days in the 70's.\r\n\r\nSince then we've learned a lot about brewing professionally. We developed easy drinking and well rounded beers with our own state of the art brewing equipment. We sold our first beer in October 2005 and now we're distributing throughout the Canaan Valley, Davis, Thomas, Elkins, Morgantown and Fayetteville.\r\n\r\nThat's our story so far.
