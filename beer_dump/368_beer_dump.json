Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "25", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "6.2", "fgMin": "1.016", "fgMax": "1.028", "abvMax": "8", "id": 15, "srmMin": "15", "name": "Scotch Ale"}, "updateDate": "2014-09-10 18:35:45", "abv": "7.2", "styleId": 15, "availableId": 4, "id": "XUY0p9", "name": "Local Grind"}, {"available": {"description": "Available during the summer months.", "id": 6, "name": "Summer"}, "isOrganic": "N", "srmId": 22, "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/7jT3nw/upload_H6WaLQ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/7jT3nw/upload_H6WaLQ-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/7jT3nw/upload_H6WaLQ-icon.png"}, "styleId": 25, "availableId": 6, "srm": {"hex": "8E2900", "id": 22, "name": "22"}, "id": "7jT3nw", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "originalGravity": "1.061", "createDate": "2012-04-23 15:05:38", "abv": "6.1", "status": "verified", "description": "Our Fall seasonal Local Harvest Ale is brewed with hops and barley grown in Maine with the clear water of Sebago Lake.

At least one regional combination of ingredients and/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager.

With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).  Our goal is to get to a comfortable production volume, enjoy what we do and love life in Northern Michigan.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bellaire", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "id": "CzopCY", "streetAddress": "121 North Bridge Street", "postalCode": "49615", "website": "http://www.shortsbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2004", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "231-533-6622", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.976269, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -85.210357, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-08-31 12:54:33", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Oj9rBb/upload_1slPUo-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Oj9rBb/upload_1slPUo-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Oj9rBb/upload_1slPUo-icon.png"}, "id": "Oj9rBb", "name": "Short's Brewing Company"}], "description": "Local\u2019s is a light, yet very tasty lager.

They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen.
