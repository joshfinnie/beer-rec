Our mantra is big, bold flavors, made exactingly with natural ingredients. So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you\u2019ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for a pint!
