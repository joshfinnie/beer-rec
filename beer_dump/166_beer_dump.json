After being thoroughly impressed with the full flavor and vision of the project, the Guthys joined the Dickinsons and the team was assembled.  Over the next months Wicked Weed Brewing found a home at 91 Biltmore avenue, a building that seemed destined to be a brewery.\r\nWith the creativity of Luke, vision of Walt, dedication of Ryan, exquisite taste of Denise and wisdom of Rick a truly unique brewery was born.
