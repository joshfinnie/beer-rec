Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast.

Esters are medium to high in  aroma, while, complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low Brettanomyces character and even clove and smoke-like phenolics may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.

The pub is part of our culture, and here in the Northwest that means locally brewed craft beer.  The local brewery is part of the fabric of the community, giving it character, individuality, and indeed, an air of hometown pride.  Bainbridge Island is certainly a great place to live, but it's been lacking one thing: our own craft microbrewery.  Well, no longer!  Bainbridge Island Brewing is the island's brewery, and the island is as much a part of us as we are of it.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-09-15 03:49:45", "locations": [{"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Tue:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\nWed:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\nThu:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\nFri:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\n\nTues - Fri: 3:00 - 9:00 pm\r\nSat & Sun: 12:00 - 9:00 pm \r\nMon: Closed for Brew Day", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bainbridge Island", "createDate": "2012-09-15 13:15:43", "id": "Oosiqt", "streetAddress": "9415 Coppertop Lane", "postalCode": "98110", "extendedAddress": "Suite 103-104", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2012", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(206) 451.4646", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 47.648325, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Washington", "longitude": -122.525356, "updateDate": "2014-09-29 20:33:48", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-09-15 13:18:09", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1KX35c/upload_YuD6by-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1KX35c/upload_YuD6by-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1KX35c/upload_YuD6by-icon.png"}, "id": "1KX35c", "name": "Bainbridge Island Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "English brown ales range from copper to brown in color.
