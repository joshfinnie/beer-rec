Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a \u201cContract Brewing\u201d or \u201cBeer Marketing\u201d company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery.\r\n\r\nThe Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words \"Skull Coast\" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company. Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Fort Mill", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "South Carolina", "longitude": -80.956275, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "803-619-9295", "streetAddress": "802 Somerton Drive", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "29715", "latitude": 35.011366, "isPrimary": "N", "id": "kXV5lc", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"inPlanning": "Y", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Hickory Location", "locality": "Hickory", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "micro", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -81.325672, "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 35.735156, "streetAddress": "883 Highland Ave SE", "createDate": "2012-04-20 18:52:08", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2012", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "postalCode": "28602", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "TjzLgu", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-04-20 19:10:08", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-icon.png"}, "id": "HX4Prz", "name": "Skull Coast Ales"}], "description": "Our Fall & Winter Seasonal, Gallows Point, is an Imperial Porter made with real Chocolate & Macadamia Nuts.
