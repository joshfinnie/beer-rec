To drown in guilt or sorrow is unhealthy and seen by some as wasted emotions. In opposition, to live our lives completely without impure influence and to be seen by all as \u201cup-tight\u201d without the ability to cut loose on occasion is viewed in equally a negative fashion. Until now, there has never been a respectable or enjoyable solution to this life long struggle.\r\nHolyBrew is a positive channel for cleansing one\u2019s mind, body and spirit of unwanted or unnecessary guilt, doubt or unhappiness. Through a recently discovered magical formula, believed to be created from the gods themselves, HolyBrew has formulated the \u201cLiquid Confession\u201d. What better way to cleanse one\u2019s soul than to partake of this succulent brew, confess one\u2019s sins and erroneous ways and let the weight of their guilt be lifted and their thirst quenched simultaneously.\r\nJoin the movement in guilt-free pleasure and refreshment.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.

Complex fruity aroma and flavor emerge reminiscent of raisins, dates, figs, grapes, plums often accompanied with a hint of winy character. Caramel, dark sugar and malty sweet flavors and aromas can be intense, not cloying, while complementing fruitiness. Though well attenuated it usually has a full, creamy body. Hop characters do not dominate; low to low-medium bitterness is perceived. Perception of alcohol can be extreme. Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma should not be evident. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Diacetyl and DMS should not be perceived. Well balanced with savoring/sipping drinkability. Oxidative character if evident in aged Quads should be mild and pleasant.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "25", "categoryId": 5, "srmMax": "20", "ibuMax": "50", "abvMin": "9", "fgMin": "1.014", "fgMax": "1.02", "abvMax": "14", "id": 60, "srmMin": "8", "name": "Belgian-Style Quadrupel"}, "id": "tsu3C5", "updateDate": "2014-07-28 20:48:38", "abv": "9.3", "styleId": 60, "ibu": "40", "name": "Quadrotriticale - Stochasticity Project"}], "numberOfPages": 683}
