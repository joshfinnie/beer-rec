Imperial Stout is the beer was originally developed for the Tsar's court in St. Petersburg. Petersburg. In the 1800s, this beer very popular. The beer bryggedes in England and sailed to Russia. In order to withstand the long journey was done beer extra strong compared to the Stout, sold in England. The beer was drained often champagne bottles.\r\n\r\nThe high alcohol content of 8% is to ensure the durability of the black beer. There used unrefined cane sugar from Mauritius as extra flavoring. Most English ales are brewed with unrefined cane sugar. By using unrefined sugar, you get tasting notes from cane sugar in the finished beer. The color is in the bright end of the scale. On the other hand, there is no added caramel color in this Stout!\r\n\r\n The taste of Aarhus Brewery Stout is thick and bold. Although it is a strong beer, it is not the hops that are dominant. This makes it easier to access than many other black beer. There is also a slight sweetness from cane sugar that is balanced with the hops. In time, hop bitterness subside, and the sweetness will dominate.\r\n\r\nThe young Stout will be a good companion to a piece of dark meat or a heavy casserole. It will certainly be obvious to drink for Christmas War or pork roast. Danish Yule developed over centuries, where we always have been drinking beer. Therefore suitable beer is just better to Danish cuisine.\r\n\r\nAarhus Brewery Stout will also be an excellent companion for all cheeses. Try to serve bread with cheese. Bread and Stouten will lift and compliment the cheeses.\r\n\r\nServing temperature of Aarhus Brewery Stout allowed to be about 10 degrees. It does not matter that the further warmed in the glass, it can easily tolerate.\r\n\r\nIn time, hop bitterness removable and sweetness will dominate.
