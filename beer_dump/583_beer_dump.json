Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale.

Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy.
