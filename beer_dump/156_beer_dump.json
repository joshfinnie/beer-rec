For many, the brewery was a thing shrouded in mystery... college students-which comprise a fair percentage of Ellensburg's population for most of the year-would occasionally see a bottle on a store shelf and ask where it came from. The likely response:\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I think some dude makes that in his basement or something...\"\r\n\r\nThe word just wasn't getting out, and things didn't look good for the tiny brewery that made exceptionally tasty ales. \r\nWell, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing. A few bars took a chance and put Iron Horse back on tap, and the beer started flowing. \r\n\r\nThe word started getting out.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:58", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "xZTJW3", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Ellensburg", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:58", "streetAddress": "1000 Prospect Street", "postalCode": "98926", "extendedAddress": "Suite 4", "website": "http://www.ironhorsebrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2004", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "509-933-3134", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 46.9994703, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Washington", "longitude": -120.5648701, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-04-01 15:22:45", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ni4EnY/upload_eun7Ba-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ni4EnY/upload_eun7Ba-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ni4EnY/upload_eun7Ba-icon.png"}, "id": "ni4EnY", "name": "Iron Horse Brewery"}], "description": "this year's version of cozy sweater in an oatmeal stout. malty, roasty, boozy, everything that you should want in a winter beer. on draft only. available until we're done with it. enjoy it while you can. it will be a different beer next year, and every year thereafter.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:02", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/YkL3RV/upload_vxLaxP-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/YkL3RV/upload_vxLaxP-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/YkL3RV/upload_vxLaxP-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and/or spices used may not always be identifiable.

A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation.
