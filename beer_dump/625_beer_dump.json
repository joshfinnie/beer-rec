Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.

All of our beers are brewed with the intention of creating something we'll enjoy drinking ourselves and, more importantly, something we're proud to put our name to. In a world of endless possibilities, we try to explore as many of them as possible, which is why to date we've brewed in excess of two hundred different beers: some of them regulars, the odd few occasionals, and far too many one-offs to remember let alone try to name!\r\nYou should be able to find our beers on offer nationwide in the kind of pubs and bars that have the freedom and willingness to stock good beer. While most of it goes into cask, you'll also find it in keg or bottle if you look in the right places.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-05-08 08:41:02", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Lawrence Hill", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "production", "region": "Bristol", "longitude": -2.5694249, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 51.4583567, "streetAddress": "Unit 4 Lawrence Hill Industrial Park", "createDate": "2013-05-09 00:37:54", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}, "postalCode": "BS5 0EB", "extendedAddress": "Croydon Street", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "pguslr", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nTue:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 10:30pm\n\nMon-Thu 4pm-11pm;\r\nFri 4pm-12am;\r\nSat 12pm-12am;\r\nSun 12pm-10:30pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Tasting Room", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bristol", "createDate": "2013-05-09 00:40:12", "id": "S0dgvI", "streetAddress": "147 Church Rd", "postalCode": "BS5 9LA", "extendedAddress": "Redfield", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "phone": "0117 939 4079", "isClosed": "N", "name": "The Old Stillage", "latitude": 51.4586634, "locationType": "tasting", "longitude": -2.5581766, "updateDate": "2014-08-25 19:12:59", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}}, {"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nTue:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nWed:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nThu:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  4:00pm - 10:30pm\n\nMon-Thu 12pm-2.30pm & 4pm-11pm;\r\nFri-Sat 12pm-12am;\r\nSun 4pm-10:30pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bristol", "createDate": "2013-05-09 00:41:57", "id": "4KMV4j", "streetAddress": "78 Saint George's Road", "postalCode": "BS1 5UR", "extendedAddress": "Hotwells", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "phone": "0117 907 0689", "isClosed": "N", "name": "The Three Tuns", "latitude": 51.4511176, "locationType": "restaurant", "longitude": -2.6049702, "updateDate": "2014-08-25 19:13:00", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-05-09 00:46:29", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3CT0MA/upload_TQKReY-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3CT0MA/upload_TQKReY-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3CT0MA/upload_TQKReY-icon.png"}, "id": "3CT0MA", "name": "Arbor Ales"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.
