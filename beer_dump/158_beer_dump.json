It fits well in wallets and tastes good under cheese. We like to think we\u2019ve got some good dough. We make pizza crust, we make sandwich bread, and we make finely crafted dog sweaters. Alright, we don\u2019t make the last one, but we COULD if we wanted to. We take pride in the freshness of our dough and veggies. Our dough was made today. It wasn\u2019t made in Topeka, frozen, shipped here, and warmed up. Ask who made it and he or she is probably in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhy no Straws? We know you didn\u2019t get one. You\u2019ll use them for about seven minutes and then we have to throw them away. It\u2019s nothing personal. If you absolutely need one we\u2019re happy to oblige, but we\u2019re trying to reduce our non-recyclables, keep our landfills at a minimum, and keep plastic out of our oceans. Find a kid and ask them about plastic. Plastic pollutes our oceans and air, so we serve our beverages in glass.

When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.

We have setup in San Diego's North County - in San Marcos, CA. This area has become known as a mecca for beer. And all you need to do be a part of it is ... Represent!\r\n\r\nStumblefoot is a name that personifies the boot strap and prototyping format we have gone about creating our brewery. The name pays tribute to our willingness to experiment.\r\n\r\nWe decided to come up with a definition that incorporates the essence of our experience:\r\nStumblefoot \u2013 \\\u2019st\u0259m \u2022 b\u0259l \u2022 fut\\ (noun) \r\n1) The art and science of gaining new knowledge through the happenstance of interesting encounters. Fortune favors the prepared.\r\nSee also: Organic, sharing, open-minded, kismet, lucky", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-09-02 14:02:27", "mailingListUrl": "http://stumblefoot.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=9e6dd3e373bec1643f8e902d8&id=5f31249e34", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Thu: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri: 3:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 7:00 pm\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 5:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Marcos", "createDate": "2013-09-02 14:03:22", "id": "X1TBQb", "streetAddress": "1784 La Costa Meadows Dr", "postalCode": "92078", "extendedAddress": "#103", "website": "http://www.stumblefoot.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2012", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(760) 208-1012", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 33.1039787, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.2192328, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-03-16 21:54:36", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/utftMS/upload_8HpBpt-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/utftMS/upload_8HpBpt-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/utftMS/upload_8HpBpt-icon.png"}, "id": "utftMS", "name": "Stumblefoot Brewing Co."}], "name": "Creekside", "createDate": "2014-02-09 12:45:51", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/FmG79d/upload_q4vYyz-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/FmG79d/upload_q4vYyz-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/FmG79d/upload_q4vYyz-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 8, "name": "North American Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.
