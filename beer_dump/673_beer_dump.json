New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:55", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Frederick", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:55", "id": "EPqUQP", "streetAddress": "4607 Wedgewood Blvd", "postalCode": "21703", "website": "http://www.flyingdogales.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1983", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "301-694-7899", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.361926, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Maryland", "longitude": -77.424677, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-11 23:24:34", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_0z9L4W-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_0z9L4W-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_0z9L4W-icon.png"}, "id": "jmGoBA", "name": "Flying Dog Brewery"}], "description": "Woody Creek White is a traditional Belgian-style Wit Beer, brewed with unique ingredients like orange peel and coriander, resulting in a refreshing and slightly citrus flavor, perfect for the \"Dog Days of Summer\".", "name": "Woody Creek", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:44:33", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/nPw4IG/upload_KH2qDq-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/nPw4IG/upload_KH2qDq-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/nPw4IG/upload_KH2qDq-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.054", "description": "Belgian-style blond ales are characterized by low yet evident hop bitterness, flavor, and sometimes aroma.
