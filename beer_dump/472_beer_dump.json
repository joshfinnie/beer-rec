Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style export ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style export ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style export ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "15", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "19", "ibuMax": "25", "abvMin": "4", "fgMin": "1.01", "fgMax": "1.018", "abvMax": "5.3", "id": 9, "srmMin": "10", "name": "Scottish-Style Export Ale"}, "updateDate": "2014-09-10 19:00:28", "abv": "4.5", "styleId": 9, "availableId": 1, "ibu": "11", "glasswareId": 5}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Located in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, Picaroons Traditional Ales, brews traditional British-style ales using malted barley, hops, our signature Hampshire yeast and water.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-10-10 16:04:16", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "CA", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Fredericton", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "New Brunswick", "longitude": -66.6425881, "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  10:00am - 10:00pm\nTue:  10:00am - 10:00pm\nWed:  10:00am - 10:00pm\nThu:  10:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  10:00am - 11:00pm\nSat:  9:00am - 11:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\n", "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 45.9627731, "streetAddress": "422 Queen St.", "createDate": "2014-10-10 16:17:17", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-10-10 16:17:17", "country": {"displayName": "Canada", "name": "CANADA", "isoThree": "CAN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 124, "isoCode": "CA"}, "postalCode": "E3B1B6", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "j6zdn3", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "updateDate": "2014-10-10 16:17:46", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qDMDRN/upload_MDO7CR-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qDMDRN/upload_MDO7CR-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qDMDRN/upload_MDO7CR-icon.png"}, "id": "qDMDRN", "name": "Picaroons Traditional Ales"}], "description": "Plaid to the Bone Heather Ale is a 4.5% abv ale made with heather tips and flowers created especially for the upcoming New Brunswick Highland Games Festival.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-10-10 16:41:19", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/3RhAea/upload_IQn4Dq-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/3RhAea/upload_IQn4Dq-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/3RhAea/upload_IQn4Dq-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and/or spices used may not always be identifiable.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "id": 132, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer"}, "updateDate": "2014-01-03 16:09:37", "abv": "5", "styleId": 132, "availableId": 3, "id": "KSZn4i", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "numberOfPages": 683}
