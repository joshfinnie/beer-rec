Hop aroma should be minimal and flavor can vary from none to medium in character intensity. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas can contribute to the character of this ale. Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character.

This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world's first fermented beverage.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Redstone products are distributed to 20 states across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado and one of the most widely distributed meads in the country!

This unique production brewery in Charlotte\u2019s NoDa neighborhood crafts small-batch premium beers, offering something for nearly every beer drinker. The North Davidson (NoDa) neighborhood is known as the creative center of Charlotte: as a natural extension of NoDa\u2019s artistic spirit, there isn\u2019t a better place for a microbrewery to call home.\r\n\r\nNoDa Brewing is a 15 barrel brewery creating the highest quality beers for local restaurants and pubs, as well as our tap room.  Our beer styles will have a Northwestern feel, showcasing American Pale Ales, India Pale Ales, and Porters.  Our small size gives us the flexibility to introduce many unique and artistic recipes as well as our renditions of classic varieties such as Imperial Stouts, Wit beers, and Winter Warmers.  Our Head Brewer frequently traveled to Europe over the past couple years.  He has been fortunate to have experienced the wonderful beers that have historically defined many current craft beer styles.  As we pay homage to these great and historic beers, we\u2019ll add an American Flair that will be embraced in the Carolinas and beyond.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:03", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday - 4 - 8:30\r\nTuesday - 4-8:30\r\nWednesday - 4-9\r\nThursday- 4-8:30\r\nFriday - 4-9:30\r\nSaturday - 12-10\r\nSunday - 1-6", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Charlotte", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:03", "id": "oGBBGF", "streetAddress": "2229 North Davidson St", "postalCode": "28205", "website": "http://www.nodabrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2011", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(704) 900-6851", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.240347, "locationType": "micro", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -80.814842, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-05-04 02:30:17", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pcrctk/upload_B1Dsle-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pcrctk/upload_B1Dsle-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pcrctk/upload_B1Dsle-icon.png"}, "id": "pcrctk", "name": "NoDa Brewing Company"}], "updateDate": "2013-08-09 16:44:05", "description": "Behold Tri-Umphant!

Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma may be evident at extremely low levels. Yeast-generated  fruity esters, including banana, are also common, but not necessary. These pale/light-colored ales may finish sweet, though any sweet finish should be light. The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "20", "categoryId": 5, "srmMax": "9", "ibuMax": "45", "abvMin": "7", "fgMin": "1.01", "fgMax": "1.018", "abvMax": "10", "id": 59, "srmMin": "4", "name": "Belgian-Style Tripel"}, "id": "4QJcH4", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "srmId": 7, "abv": "9.7", "styleId": 59, "availableId": 1, "srm": {"hex": "F39C00", "id": 7, "name": "7"}, "ibu": "35", "glasswareId": 6}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Triumphator", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:44:25", "breweries": [{"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:01", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "DE", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "M\u00c3?\u00c2\u00bcnchen", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Bayern", "longitude": 12.533549, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "49-(0)89-/-5200-0", "streetAddress": "Nymphenburger Stra\u00c3?\u00c5\u00b8e 4", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:01", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Germany", "name": "GERMANY", "isoThree": "DEU", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 276, "isoCode": "DE"}, "latitude": 47.794926, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "nKDCcy", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "updateDate": "2012-03-21 19:06:07", "id": "tl4MM8", "name": "L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u Startseite"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.033", "description": "Ordinary bitter is gold to copper colored with medium bitterness, light to medium body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness.
