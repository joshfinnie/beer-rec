Rickoli\u2019s respects the liquid in the glass and wants to help elevate beer to a refined drinking experience. That\u2019s why we use the finest ingredients and brew in a leisurely manner. The beer tells us when it\u2019s ready. We refuse to be a slave to production deadlines.  Wheat Ridge Colorado is a relaxed community just west of Denver with easy access from I-70. Wheat Ridge was one of the few remaining enclaves along the Front Range without a microbrewery. This changed in November 2012!  We are dedicated to providing our local neighborhood with a place to relax and have a pint close to home.\r\n\r\nOur Brew master, Rick Abitbol has been professionally brewing award winning beers along the Front Range for over a decade.  Rick is respectful of beer styles and traditional brewing technique.  And has long been an innovator of style and not afraid to color outside the lines. He was one of the first brewers to explore the Black IPA which has since come to be regarded as a new style in judging guidelines.   We love hops! That\u2019s not to say you won\u2019t find any wonderfully malty creations on tap there are many, but what you will notice is the variety in our hoppy selections.  Be on the lookout for Rick\u2019s special brews!\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re Talking Much Better Beer!  We are pleased to feature a great selection of Gluten Reduced Beer.  All Rickoli\u2019s brews that do not contain wheat are considered gluten reduced.  Making great craft beer more accessible to everyone.\r\n  \r\nOur glass rinsing stations insure a beer clean glass every time! We want you to drink beer not sanitizer!

Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "10", "categoryId": 4, "srmMax": "9", "ibuMax": "15", "abvMin": "4.4", "fgMin": "1.008", "fgMax": "1.012", "abvMax": "5.4", "id": 47, "srmMin": "3", "name": "Leipzig-Style Gose"}, "updateDate": "2014-04-23 11:53:29", "abv": "5.7", "styleId": 47, "id": "oqsjeJ", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Surprisingly smooth and easy to drink with little bitterness.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "HeStKS", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Potosi", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "streetAddress": "209 South Main Street", "postalCode": "53820", "extendedAddress": "Box 177", "website": "http://www.potosibrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1852", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "608-763-4002", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.6716654, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -90.7271709, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-01-08 21:22:00", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-icon.png"}, "id": "Q4eTmd", "name": "Potosi Brewing Company"}], "name": "Steamboat Shandy", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:44:17", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/JolGdL/upload_a92PtZ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/JolGdL/upload_a92PtZ-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/JolGdL/upload_a92PtZ-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
