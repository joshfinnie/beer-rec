The most important aspect for us is that we keep our traditional heritage. As we know the saying \"New is not in comparison with the word better\".\r\n\r\nThe Schlossbrauerei Au-Halltertau respects the tradition and heritage of quality traditional premium brewing. For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally. The first documented brew master was the royal court brew master named \"Schweiger\" in 1590. At that time the Noble Freiherr Baron von Thurn was the lord of the castle. He was the fourth noble lord since 990 a.d through 1281 a.d that ruled in Au Hallertau.\r\n\r\nSince 1846 the Noble rulers and Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz have ruled and resided in the magnificent \"Moated Castle\" in Au i.d. Hallertau.\r\n\r\nThe noble family of Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz is still living in the castle an in the meantime it is the 6th generation.\r\n\r\nAt present Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz is making sure that the Castle Brewery stays a traditional brewery together with the necessary vision into the future to create a sustainable traditional premium quality future.\r\n\r\nMichael Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz\u2019s utmost desire is not to miss a successful sustainable future and at the same time to keep up the 6 generations of writing a successful historical event for the Castle brewery and it history.\r\n\r\nThe Brew Master Mr. Stefan Ebensperger is supporting the Baron with his highly qualified experience and skills. The necessary emotions and bindings towards a brewing heritage that has been passed down for generations is needed. Tradition is naturally one of the highest priorities for Mr. Ebensperger due to our traditional purity laws dating back to 1516 a.d therefore you can be assured that the quality is a premium German and he says, \"It will also stay like that\". Since 1516 the Bavarians have known how important the quality of the ingredients and the brewing process actually are. Beer was known during the Middle Ages as the same significant value as bread. As a part of the staple die, it was also germ free and full of healthy calories. During that time the average citizen spent a good 20 percent of their income on beer.\r\n\r\nOn the 23. April 1516 the Bavaria Duke Wilhelm IV. Executed and introduced the famous Bavarian Purity law into the Bavarian Parliament in Ingolstadt with the famous words: \"Just like beer in Summer an in winter as well as the county or province it is brewed or served\" Since that day it is prohibited to brew beer for the German market with anything else apart from hops, malt, water and yeast. In 1918 the Weimarer Republik accepted the Bavarian purity law into its republic, therefore the Bavarian purity then became a German law. Under the purity law or Bavaria and Germany the Castle Brewery, inspects, insures and stores all its quality premium beers as in the past historical way the Castle Lords and Brew Masters did.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "vPPBkD", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Au in der Hallertau", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "streetAddress": "Schlossbr\u00e4ugasse 2", "postalCode": "84072", "website": "http://www.auer-bier.de/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1590", "countryIsoCode": "DE", "phone": "+49 / 87 52 / 86 32", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 48.558307, "locationType": "micro", "longitude": 11.741228, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Germany", "name": "GERMANY", "isoThree": "DEU", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 276, "isoCode": "DE"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-03-21 19:06:19", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HJTHzW/upload_YbYgau-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HJTHzW/upload_YbYgau-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HJTHzW/upload_YbYgau-icon.png"}, "id": "HJTHzW", "name": "Schlossbrauerei Au-Hallertau"}], "name": "Hopfengold", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:25", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/qWCQEQ/upload_aphIMC-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/qWCQEQ/upload_aphIMC-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/qWCQEQ/upload_aphIMC-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 7, "name": "European-germanic Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.048", "description": "Dortmunder has medium hop bitterness.

Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school.

Rather than oak, we\u2019ve selected the delicate wood of a fallen Virginia Tulip Poplar, which was TreeCycled by CitiWood and toasted for use in this hearty IPA. While this Poplar can no longer rustle in the wind or give shade, it is able to offer balance to the bright citrus and pine character from heaps of Cascade, Columbus and Summit hops with subtle notes of caramelized vanilla. And the tree was hoppy.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1800s, when the early IPAs were being shipped in wooden barrels from the breweries of Burton-on-Trent to thirsty British colonists in India, our Tulip Poplar was a mere sapling on the outskirts of Richmond, Virginia. On September 18, 2003, this towering Poplar prevailed to the fierce Hurricane Isabel and fell on Bell Creek Road. Richmond-based CitiWood Urban Forest Products helped us transform the wood from this fallen Poplar into custom designed flavor- and aroma-enhancing infusion sticks. Post fermentation, Hoplar is dry-hopped with a generous helping of whole-flower Cascade hops and conditioned on the toasted Poplar.\r\n\r\nHardywood Hoplar is mahogany in color with a hearty, tan head and offers an aroma of grapefruit br\u00fbl\u00e9e and pine needles, as well as delicate vanilla toffee and a hint of campfire. Medium- to full-bodied with assertive (100 IBUs) yet delightful hop bitterness, Hoplar is balanced with ample caramel malt backbone. A bit of earthy tannin from the Poplar harmonizes with the resinous hoppy character, which dissipates into a lingering finish.

We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family. \r\nThe promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.\r\n\r\nToday our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.\r\nWe have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do.

In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States.
