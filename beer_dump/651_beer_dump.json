From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "DrFlD0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Carlsbad", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "571 Carlsbad Village Dr.", "postalCode": "92008", "website": "http://www.pizzaport.com/locations/carlsbad/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1997", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "760-720-7007", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Carlsbad", "latitude": 33.1596505, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.3478111, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Sun - Thur - 11am - 10pm\r\nFri - Sat. - 11am - Midnight", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Solana Beach", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "id": "qAyZMR", "streetAddress": "135 N.

Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.

Brewer\u2019s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer\u2019s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer\u2019s Alley is back!\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley\u2019s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the \"new\" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer\u2019s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it\u2019s kind in town.\r\n\r\nAs the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick\u2019s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick\u2019s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith\u2019s film \"The Birth of a Nation\", and the Manhattan Opera Company\u2019s production of \"Madame Butterfly\", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland\u2019s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.\r\n\r\nWe are most happy to oversee the building\u2019s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.\r\n\r\nWe opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:48", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "Qs29uy", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Frederick", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:48", "streetAddress": "124 North Market Street", "postalCode": "21701", "website": "http://www.brewers-alley.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "301-631-0089", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.4156043, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Maryland", "longitude": -77.4107676, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-10-10 17:02:34", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-icon.png"}, "id": "wFeIiC", "name": "Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery"}], "description": "Modeled after the Alt style from D\u00fcsseldorf, Wedding Alt is characterized by a clean, balanced flavor that is ushered in by subtle hop aroma.
