By the early 1980s, the last one had shuttered its doors. So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cleveland", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "id": "8dIvZw", "streetAddress": "1947 West 28th Street", "postalCode": "44113", "website": "http://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1988", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "216-771-4404", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.484295, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -81.705375, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cleveland", "createDate": "2013-12-10 17:48:32", "id": "xSmsLL", "streetAddress": "2516 Market Avenue", "postalCode": "44113", "website": "http://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/brewpub/around-the-brewpub", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "216-771-4404", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Great Lakes Brewpub", "latitude": 41.484446, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -81.704436, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-09-10 20:44:32", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uSFO4T/upload_O5TpB8-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uSFO4T/upload_O5TpB8-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uSFO4T/upload_O5TpB8-icon.png"}, "id": "uSFO4T", "name": "Great Lakes Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 2, "name": "Irish Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties).
