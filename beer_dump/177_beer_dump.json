Having been homebrewing for a couple of years, Tom wrote a \u2018cartoon\u2019 of a business plan that stated that a 3 barrel brewery could make a profit (in the first year, no less!).\r\n\r\nArmed with said business plan and a cashed in 401k, Tom and his wife DeAnn proceeded to convert a metal storage shed on their property into a nascent brewery.\r\n\r\nLake Louie Brewing is located on 18.5 acres of land purchased from Tom\u2019s uncle Louie Carpenter (hence the name \u2018Lake Louie\u2019) near the small town of Arena, Wisconsin (population: not too many, traffic lights: zero).  Lake Louie was the skinny dipping pond for area youth (including Tom in his day).\r\n\r\nAt the end of one full year\u2019s brewing, Lake Louie has produced the astounding sum of 106 barrels of beer.  2001 year end totals:  276 barrels.  A 258% increase in one year (lookout Bud!).", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:00", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "fHseLN", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Arena", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:00", "streetAddress": "7556 Pine Road", "postalCode": "53503", "website": "http://www.lakelouie.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "608-753-2675", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 43.1706377, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -89.9323658, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-09-16 19:27:32", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PfbcZa/upload_u4xMHf-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PfbcZa/upload_u4xMHf-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PfbcZa/upload_u4xMHf-icon.png"}, "id": "PfbcZa", "name": "Lake Louie Brewing"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "description": "Any style of beer can be made stronger than the classic style guidelines.

All the ingredients are as fresh as possible, some are even home grown. American malts, hops, and yeast are the mainstay of our beers. The water is from our 450' well and is just as pure and clean as can be.

The Saratoga Resort and Spa consistently draws people from all over Colorado and Wyoming due to its unique offering of a variety of amenities in one location--such as an on-site brewery, mineral hot spring pools, great food, western-styled rooms, jeep, ATV and snowmobile rentals, a golf course and a full-service spa.  \r\n\r\nThe Snowy Mountain Brewery is gaining in exposure and was featured recently in Travel Pulse\u2019s \u201c5 Unique Beer Vacation Spots in the U.S.!\u201d  The name Snowy Mountain is fitting for the brewery as it sits adjacent the majestic Snowy Range Mountains, in southern Wyoming. Boasting 8-10 different craft beers throughout each season, the Snowy Mountain Brewery is one of the fastest growing breweries in Wyoming and surrounding states. The famous brewpub, with a throw-back to the wild west, is adorned with big game mounts and bar-stools made with six-shooters and patinated saddles and features a full pub menu with selections that compliment Saratoga's finest craft beers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Hours: 3 PM \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 9 PM", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Saratoga", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "id": "6txGoK", "streetAddress": "601 Pic Pike Rd", "postalCode": "82331", "extendedAddress": "PO Box 869", "website": "http://www.saratogaresortandspa.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "307-760-2302", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Snowy Mountain Pub & Brewery", "latitude": 41.4534072, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Wyoming", "longitude": -106.8020015, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-09-19 17:53:04", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_4X9zOz-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_4X9zOz-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_4X9zOz-icon.png"}, "id": "u8Rbm0", "name": "Snowy Mountain Brewery"}], "srm": {"hex": "F8A600", "id": 6, "name": "6"}, "servingTemperature": "cold", "updateDate": "2014-09-16 13:18:42", "ibu": "40.7"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.dirtybucketbrewery.com/", "established": "2012", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Dirty Bucket Brewing Co. started over exactly that...a dirty bucket.
