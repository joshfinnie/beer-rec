From that conversation forward there would be no looking back. A business plan was developed and hundreds of test batches brewed. In 2011 Walt and Luke\u2019s lifelong friend Ryan Guthy and his parents Rick and Denise all sat down at their house in the mountains of Western North Carolina to taste some of Luke and Walt\u2019s creations while looking over the plans for what would be Wicked Weed Brewing.  After being thoroughly impressed with the full flavor and vision of the project, the Guthys joined the Dickinsons and the team was assembled.  Over the next months Wicked Weed Brewing found a home at 91 Biltmore avenue, a building that seemed destined to be a brewery.\r\nWith the creativity of Luke, vision of Walt, dedication of Ryan, exquisite taste of Denise and wisdom of Rick a truly unique brewery was born.  So from the humble beginning of a basement, the dream of Wicked Weed Brewing has come to life. Our beer is bold, full of excitement and flavor.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "DF5YsC", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Boston", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "streetAddress": "30 Germania Street", "postalCode": "02130", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-800-372-1131", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.314449, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Massachusetts", "longitude": -71.103365, "updateDate": "2014-09-26 13:04:52", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "MLUbXI", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2013-08-12 13:10:57", "streetAddress": "1625 Central Parkway", "postalCode": "45214", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-412-3200", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Cincinnati", "latitude": 39.1144986, "locationType": "production", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5222061, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-08-03 14:19:13", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_jea6Pe-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_jea6Pe-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_jea6Pe-icon.png"}, "id": "1wSztN", "name": "Boston Beer Company"}, {"website": "http://www.dogfish.com/", "established": "1995", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Dogfish Head Craft Brewery makes off-centered ales for off-centered people.

Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a \u201cContract Brewing\u201d or \u201cBeer Marketing\u201d company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery.\r\n\r\nThe Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words \"Skull Coast\" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company. Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Fort Mill", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "South Carolina", "longitude": -80.956275, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "803-619-9295", "streetAddress": "802 Somerton Drive", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "29715", "latitude": 35.011366, "isPrimary": "N", "id": "kXV5lc", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"inPlanning": "Y", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Hickory Location", "locality": "Hickory", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "micro", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -81.325672, "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 35.735156, "streetAddress": "883 Highland Ave SE", "createDate": "2012-04-20 18:52:08", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2012", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "postalCode": "28602", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "TjzLgu", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-04-20 19:10:08", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-icon.png"}, "id": "HX4Prz", "name": "Skull Coast Ales"}], "description": "Our Extra Pale Ale is brewed with real Almonds.

These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers.

At Brothers Drake, our philosophy on making mead is based on the following principles:\r\n\r\n1. Start Local: We buy local honey, support local agriculture, and produce a local product.\r\n\r\n2. Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices.
