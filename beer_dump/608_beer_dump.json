This, to us, means the comprehensive enjoyment of beer in a way that enhances the overall experience of life.\r\n\r\nThe basic formula for our entire lineup of hand-crafted Baird Beer is the same: Balance + Complexity = Character. We are dedicated to the crafting of beer that bursts with flavor and character. We will not brew vapid beer and we are not afraid of not appealing to everyone. We brew to our own exacting standards and it is our daily mission to not disappoint ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn addition to crafting Baird Beer, we also own and directly operate a growing stable of beer pubs which we call our Taprooms (Numazu Fishmarket Taproom, Nakameguro Taproom, etc.). Baird Beer also is sold through a steadily expanding family of outside pubs, restaurants and liquor stores in Japan as well as being exported to select international markets. Consumer purchases of Baird Beer direct from the brewery are possible through our online estore (delivery only within Japan).", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "AzIZR4", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Numazu", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "streetAddress": "9-3, Tadehara-cho", "postalCode": "410-0843", "website": "http://bairdbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2000", "countryIsoCode": "JP", "phone": "055-952-6673", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.082445, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Shizuoka", "longitude": 138.861084, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Japan", "name": "JAPAN", "isoThree": "JPN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 392, "isoCode": "JP"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-03-21 19:06:20", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/NDPKIS/upload_gm1SXH-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/NDPKIS/upload_gm1SXH-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/NDPKIS/upload_gm1SXH-icon.png"}, "id": "NDPKIS", "name": "Baird Brewing Company"}], "name": "The Carpenter\u2019s Mikan Ale", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "updateDate": "2012-03-22 13:05:43", "abv": "6", "availableId": 4, "id": "6ECJfV", "glasswareId": 5}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.ravenbeer.com/home.html", "established": "1998", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Our beer was first conceived in Luxembourg between founders Stephen Demczuk and Wolfgang Stark.
