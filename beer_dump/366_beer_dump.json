We are high-volume, fast paced and right in the middle of all the action for the dozens of events that take place right outside our doorstep on Prescott's hometown Courthouse Plaza. We are community minded and involved in many local events and fundraisers. Our kitchen is a 99% scratch kitchen, providing a large & varied menu. Our bar is lively and we attract people of all ages and backgrounds. We are hands-on owners and look for managers with the same philosophy.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re also pleased to announce that Prescott Brewing Company, the MICROBREWERY, is now an extension of our brewery operations!  With the introduction of PBC\u2019s Liquid Amber Ale and Ponderosa IPA in cans, we quickly outgrew our little 7-barrel brewhouse that\u2019s been our workhorse since opening in 1994.  So we bit the bullet and built an off-site microbrewery production plant out by the Prescott airport in 2011.  The first 30-barrel batch of Liquid Amber was brewed by John and Lead Brewer, Jan, on December 27th, 2011 and was a true better- late- than- never Christmas gift!  Look for both brands increasingly available throughout Arizona.  And thus the story continues.  \r\n\r\nPBC celebrated its 20TH ANNIVERSARY downtown Prescott in March of 2014\u2026.thanks to our many loyal supporters, locals and visitors alike. 20 years of hard labor...nah, not that bad, but 20 years in the restaurant business is a LONG time!  So, we\u2019ll just keep on keepin\u2019 on and are excited to expand the selection of canned product for distribution as production allows out at the airport location.\r\n\r\nYOU are included amongst those who've allowed us to thrive, contribute to our community and keep 65-75 employees on staff all year long! As everyone knows, these have been difficult times for many. We believe every one of us knows personally of someone who has struggled these past few years with job loss, or a small business owner who has had to lay off a good employee, or maybe has had to close their business. Luckily, PBC is okay, thanks to YOU. Not to say we wouldn\u2019t want more of the dining dollars out there...but we\u2019re extremely grateful for the continued support of those in our community and visitors from literally all over the world. We\u2019d like to remind everyone that each of us can make a difference in our communities by shopping local, supporting locally-owned, independent businesses, supporting our local charities and non-profits and volunteering for our favorite causes.

At least one regional combination of ingredients and/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.
