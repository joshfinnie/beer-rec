It is 6.6% alcohol by volume. At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught.\r\n\r\nAccording to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.\r\n\r\nA \"blonde\" version of Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum barrels was produced.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-08-03 00:34:11", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.innisandgunn.com/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 55.951976, "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Edinburgh", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "longitude": -3.211095, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "+44 (0) 131 337 4420", "streetAddress": "6 Randolph Crescent", "createDate": "2012-08-03 12:39:07", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}, "postalCode": "EH3 7TH", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "0HAazs", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-08-03 12:40:12", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-icon.png"}, "id": "jC0TAa", "name": "Innis & Gunn"}], "name": "Toasted Oak India Pale Ale", "createDate": "2013-11-19 15:46:58", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/RUPK6D/upload_NWRKeU-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/RUPK6D/upload_NWRKeU-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/RUPK6D/upload_NWRKeU-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
