By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 151,000 barrels of beer and 9,100 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "locations": [{"openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "d8IJKF", "locationTypeDisplay": "Office", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Abita Springs", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "streetAddress": "PO Box 1510", "postalCode": "70420", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1986", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "800-737-2311", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 30.482408, "locationType": "office", "region": "Louisiana", "longitude": -90.056605, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Tasting Room", "locality": "Abita Springs", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Louisiana", "longitude": -90.055185, "hoursOfOperation": "Wed:  2:00pm - 3:00pm\nThu:  2:00pm - 3:00pm\nFri:  2:00pm - 3:00pm\nSat:  10:00am - 3:00pm\n\n", "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 30.482138, "streetAddress": "21084 Louisiana 36", "createDate": "2012-09-29 14:34:50", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:38:49", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "70433", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "PdSE1h", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Tue:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Abita Springs", "createDate": "2012-09-29 14:36:40", "id": "1xB2B8", "streetAddress": "72011 Holly Street", "postalCode": "70420", "website": "http://www.abitabrewpub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2004", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(985) 892-5837", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Brewpub", "latitude": 30.4787288, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Louisiana", "longitude": -90.0388438, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:38:50", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-08-12 21:42:59", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BBE5WM/upload_WCZDku-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BBE5WM/upload_WCZDku-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BBE5WM/upload_WCZDku-icon.png"}, "id": "BBE5WM", "name": "Abita Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.08", "description": "See British Origin American-Style Imperial Porter Imperial porters are very dark brown to black in color.

When Reuben and I took Adam to Bob\u2019s (our friendly, neighborhood homebrew supply store) to pick up his kit, I was expecting to pick up a little tin of \u201cbeer mix\u201d and a bucket to brew.  We were a bit surprised and overwhelmed by the seriousness of this beer-brewing business.  I thought, \u201cOh great, there\u2019s more storage space gone once Adam gives up on this little hobby in a month\u2019s time.\u201d  Even though I rarely admit to being wrong now that we\u2019re married, I couldn\u2019t have been farther from the mark thinking that this would be an easily discarded hobby.  The first brewing system has been dwarfed by the upgraded and supersized brewhouse, and there has been no chance for the mash tun, brew kettle, or hot liquor tank to gather any dust!  Adam\u2019s hobby turned into full-blown obsession, and in tribute to the little man who started it all, Reuben\u2019s Brews was born!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "mailingListUrl": "http://www.reubensbrews.com/contact/", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "6mYnLr", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Seattle", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "streetAddress": "1406 NW 53rd Street", "latitude": 47.6673244, "extendedAddress": "Suite 1A", "website": "http://www.reubensbrews.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2011", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "98107", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Washington", "longitude": -122.3741648, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-10-02 17:05:18", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n2527g/upload_wIJHWr-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n2527g/upload_wIJHWr-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n2527g/upload_wIJHWr-icon.png"}, "id": "n2527g", "name": "Reuben's Brews"}], "description": "A full, rich and smooth stout.
