Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a \u201cbeer kit\u201d from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.\r\nAs of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.  At Engine 15 Brewing Co. you\u2019ll find a friendly atmosphere where you can enjoy a dizzying array of beers, both brewed in house and imported from the far reaches of the globe, eat a tasty meal and even brew your own beer!\r\n\r\nEngine 15 \u2013 Eat, Drink, Brew!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:54", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Tue - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Jacksonville Beach", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:54", "id": "E6WUse", "streetAddress": "1500 Beach Blvd", "postalCode": "32250", "website": "http://www.engine15.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "904-249-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 30.287586, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Florida", "longitude": -81.4081999, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "updateDate": "2012-03-21 19:06:16", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VajTuz/upload_bLpL5G-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VajTuz/upload_bLpL5G-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VajTuz/upload_bLpL5G-icon.png"}, "id": "VajTuz", "name": "Engine 15 Brewing Company"}], "name": "Christmas Quad", "createDate": "2013-12-05 12:32:43", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Y0zLUf/upload_OTT8zH-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Y0zLUf/upload_OTT8zH-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Y0zLUf/upload_OTT8zH-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.084", "description": "Quadrupels or \"Quads\" are characterized by the immense presence of alcohol and balanced flavor, bitterness and aromas.

Flanders brown ales have low to medium bitterness and a cocoa-like character from roast malt. Roasted malt character in aroma and flavor is acceptable at low levels. A very low degree of malt sweetness may be present and in balance with the acidity produced by Lactobacillus activity. Oak-like or woody characters may be pleasantly integrated into overall palate. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Some versions may be more highly carbonated and, when bottle conditioned, may appear cloudy (yeast) when served. These final beers are often blended old with new before packaging in order to create the brewer's intended balance of characters.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "15", "categoryId": 5, "srmMax": "20", "ibuMax": "25", "abvMin": "4.8", "fgMin": "1.008", "fgMax": "1.016", "abvMax": "6.5", "id": 57, "srmMin": "12", "name": "Belgian-Style Flanders Oud Bruin or Oud Red Ales"}, "id": "z3VfEn", "updateDate": "2014-09-30 17:45:36", "abv": "5", "styleId": 57, "availableId": 2, "ibu": "15", "name": "Ciel Rouge A Nuit"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Limited availability.", "id": 2, "name": "Limited"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.3floyds.com", "established": "1996", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Three Floyds Brewing Company LLC was founded in 1996 by brothers Nick and Simon with their father Mike Floyd.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "71LkGn", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Munster", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "streetAddress": "9750 Indiana Parkway", "postalCode": "46321", "website": "http://www.threefloydspub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-219-922-3565", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.535536, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -87.516687, "updateDate": "2014-10-20 15:53:00", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "GoDmMT", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Munster", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:16", "streetAddress": "9750 Indiana Parkway", "postalCode": "46321", "website": "http://www.3floyds.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "219-922-4425", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Munster", "latitude": 41.535536, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -87.516687, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-08-09 13:56:10", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_WREfmT-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_WREfmT-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_WREfmT-icon.png"}, "id": "iodDki", "name": "Three Floyds Brewing Company"}], "description": "In the seemingly endless cruelty, battle and strife of the Hyborian Age, a warrior has but two pleasures: decimating one\u2019s enemies in battle, and a horn of Cimmerian Sabertooth Berzerker to slake the thirst of victory.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-05-27 16:15:06", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/JUSPtY/upload_AV3IGN-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/JUSPtY/upload_AV3IGN-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/JUSPtY/upload_AV3IGN-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
