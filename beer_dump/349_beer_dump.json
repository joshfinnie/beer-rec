This, to us, means the comprehensive enjoyment of beer in a way that enhances the overall experience of life.\r\n\r\nThe basic formula for our entire lineup of hand-crafted Baird Beer is the same: Balance + Complexity = Character. We are dedicated to the crafting of beer that bursts with flavor and character. We will not brew vapid beer and we are not afraid of not appealing to everyone. We brew to our own exacting standards and it is our daily mission to not disappoint ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn addition to crafting Baird Beer, we also own and directly operate a growing stable of beer pubs which we call our Taprooms (Numazu Fishmarket Taproom, Nakameguro Taproom, etc.).

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 3, "id": 40, "name": "American-Style Sour Ale"}, "updateDate": "2013-05-03 00:55:10", "abv": "7", "styleId": 40, "availableId": 1, "id": "bZtJRt", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.rognessbrewing.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Rogness Brewing Company specializes in creating small, handcrafted batches of beer.

Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character.
