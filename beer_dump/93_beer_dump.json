The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

Brewed with several European and American hop varieties for just enough bitterness to balance out the malt, Blood Moon has many nuances that change with each sip as the beer warms.

It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:05", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "wbpj5b", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chicago", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:05", "streetAddress": "1675 N Western Ave", "postalCode": "60647", "website": "http://www.pipeworksbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2009", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "773-725-9428", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.912447, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.686905, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-08-09 14:25:22", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_CymH7H-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_CymH7H-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_CymH7H-icon.png"}, "id": "fz3g3i", "name": "Pipeworks Brewing Company"}], "description": "In this epic battle, the Blood of the Unicorn has been shed by the sword of the deadly assassin of the east.
