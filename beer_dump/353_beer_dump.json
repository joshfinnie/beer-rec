By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:50", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:50", "id": "qo6LCf", "streetAddress": "1621 Moore St.", "postalCode": "45202", "website": "http://www.christianmoerlein.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1853", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-827-6025", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery, General Offices and Taproom", "latitude": 39.1137948, "locationType": "production", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5150108, "updateDate": "2014-07-27 12:11:20", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nTue:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nThu:  1:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2012-08-02 18:10:31", "id": "X0HMO8", "streetAddress": "115 Joe Nuxhall Way", "postalCode": "45202", "website": "http://www.moerleinlagerhouse.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2012", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-421-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Christian Moerlein Lager House", "latitude": 39.0963619, "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5087017, "updateDate": "2014-07-27 12:10:27", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-27 12:12:28", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-icon.png"}, "id": "Em1uno", "name": "Christian Moerlein Brewing Company"}], "description": "Brewed to the same standards that made Moerlein the first American beer to certifiably pass the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law, this M\u00fcnchner-styled Helles is a remarkably balanced lager featuring a lightly toasted, yet defined malt character, and a touch of hops for a clean finish.", "name": "Lager House", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:35", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/0Rekp2/upload_BX2Fmk-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/0Rekp2/upload_BX2Fmk-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/0Rekp2/upload_BX2Fmk-icon.png"}, "originalGravity": "1.05", "id": "0Rekp2", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 7, "name": "European-germanic Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness.

Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style.

Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.
