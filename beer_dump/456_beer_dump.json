This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

We offer family friendly dining with a children\u2019s play area, as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is very much \u201cfarm-to-fork,\u201d working closely with North Carolina pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...\r\n\r\nWe are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "mailingListUrl": "http://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/manage/optin/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Durham", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "id": "vGotFH", "streetAddress": "107 East Parrish Street", "postalCode": "27701", "extendedAddress": "Suite 105", "website": "http://www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2011", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "919-680-2333", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.995445, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -78.899939, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-09-25 18:50:22", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_8LAKzQ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_8LAKzQ-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_8LAKzQ-icon.png"}, "id": "eu1cAn", "name": "Bull City Burger and Brewery"}], "name": "Parrish St. Ale", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:55", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/jpMUXr/upload_B9C8TE-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/jpMUXr/upload_B9C8TE-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/jpMUXr/upload_B9C8TE-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
