Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "35", "categoryId": 9, "srmMax": "40", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "7.5", "fgMin": "1.016", "fgMax": "1.022", "abvMax": "9", "id": 104, "srmMin": "40", "name": "Baltic-Style Porter"}, "updateDate": "2013-06-11 12:28:44", "abv": "8.15", "styleId": 104, "srm": {"hex": "6A0E00", "id": 28, "name": "28"}, "ibu": "76.4", "name": "Two Penny"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.croptonbrewery.com/", "established": "1984", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Perched on the edge of the North Yorkshire Moors National Park, Cropton Brewery has been producing award-winning real ales since 1984.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Pickering", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "North Yorkshire", "longitude": -0.84029, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "44-(01751)-417330", "streetAddress": "Cropton", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}, "latitude": 54.289902, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "kCzHBO", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-04-13 15:13:01", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ky67c2/upload_iB7bco-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ky67c2/upload_iB7bco-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ky67c2/upload_iB7bco-icon.png"}, "id": "Ky67c2", "name": "Cropton Brewery"}], "description": "Our very first brew and still our most popular cask beer.

In 2011 Walt and Luke\u2019s lifelong friend Ryan Guthy and his parents Rick and Denise all sat down at their house in the mountains of Western North Carolina to taste some of Luke and Walt\u2019s creations while looking over the plans for what would be Wicked Weed Brewing.  After being thoroughly impressed with the full flavor and vision of the project, the Guthys joined the Dickinsons and the team was assembled.  Over the next months Wicked Weed Brewing found a home at 91 Biltmore avenue, a building that seemed destined to be a brewery.\r\nWith the creativity of Luke, vision of Walt, dedication of Ryan, exquisite taste of Denise and wisdom of Rick a truly unique brewery was born.  So from the humble beginning of a basement, the dream of Wicked Weed Brewing has come to life. Our beer is bold, full of excitement and flavor.  Always focused on drinkability and pushing the boundaries of what we think we are capable of.  Wicked Weed Brewing will always evolve, always grow and always aspire to be greater.
