While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.struisebrouwers.be/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Woesten", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "West-Vlaanderen", "countryIsoCode": "BE", "longitude": 2.7831, "country": {"displayName": "Belgium", "name": "BELGIUM", "isoThree": "BEL", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 56, "isoCode": "BE"}, "isClosed": "N", "streetAddress": "Woesten", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2001", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "latitude": 50.900311, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "qcAp7N", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-10-30 11:30:48", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_rK0nnu-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_rK0nnu-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_rK0nnu-icon.png"}, "id": "bjwFtZ", "name": "De Struise"}], "description": "We send our approach for the Svea IPA.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty.

Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
