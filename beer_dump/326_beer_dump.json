Soon he found himself president and heading up the Marin County State Fair competitions, and after burning out all the burners on the stove, he was banished to brewing outdoors. A certified beer judge, he worked at Marin Brewing Company before starting off on his own, moving south to Carpinteria. Now a family run brewery, Island Brewing Company has won awards on both the state and national level.

In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm).

It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "10", "categoryId": 11, "srmMax": "10", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "3.5", "fgMin": "1.006", "fgMax": "1.018", "abvMax": "5.5", "id": 112, "srmMin": "4", "name": "Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast"}, "updateDate": "2012-03-22 13:04:58", "styleId": 112, "id": "7jib1b", "name": "Issaquah Bullfrog Ale"}], "numberOfPages": 683}
