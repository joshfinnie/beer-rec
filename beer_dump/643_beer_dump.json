There was an influx of immigrant brewers to Mexico in the 19th century and Vienna Lager was a fave of Maximilian I during his wing-ding there according to all things internet. This lager style is very robust in flavor as a result of its namesake malt (vienna) which is roughly the color of Pale malt.  These beers are typically decoction mashed which is a time honored method for lager brewing in Germany but we have an infusion mash tun, so guess what?  I think our mash tun did a pretty good job.

The Saratoga Resort and Spa consistently draws people from all over Colorado and Wyoming due to its unique offering of a variety of amenities in one location--such as an on-site brewery, mineral hot spring pools, great food, western-styled rooms, jeep, ATV and snowmobile rentals, a golf course and a full-service spa.  \r\n\r\nThe Snowy Mountain Brewery is gaining in exposure and was featured recently in Travel Pulse\u2019s \u201c5 Unique Beer Vacation Spots in the U.S.!\u201d  The name Snowy Mountain is fitting for the brewery as it sits adjacent the majestic Snowy Range Mountains, in southern Wyoming. Boasting 8-10 different craft beers throughout each season, the Snowy Mountain Brewery is one of the fastest growing breweries in Wyoming and surrounding states. The famous brewpub, with a throw-back to the wild west, is adorned with big game mounts and bar-stools made with six-shooters and patinated saddles and features a full pub menu with selections that compliment Saratoga's finest craft beers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Hours: 3 PM \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 9 PM", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Saratoga", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "id": "6txGoK", "streetAddress": "601 Pic Pike Rd", "postalCode": "82331", "extendedAddress": "PO Box 869", "website": "http://www.saratogaresortandspa.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "307-760-2302", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Snowy Mountain Pub & Brewery", "latitude": 41.4534072, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Wyoming", "longitude": -106.8020015, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-09-19 17:53:04", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_4X9zOz-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_4X9zOz-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_4X9zOz-icon.png"}, "id": "u8Rbm0", "name": "Snowy Mountain Brewery"}], "srm": {"hex": "E58500", "id": 9, "name": "9"}, "servingTemperature": "cold", "updateDate": "2014-09-16 13:40:58", "ibu": "26.5"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available during the fall months.", "id": 7, "name": "Fall"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.squatters.com/", "established": "1989", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Although much has changed (now three locations and a microbrewery), we remain firmly dedicated to our original goal; provide our customers world-class handcrafted beer and food in a warm, friendly environment.\r\n\r\nAs Squatters grew we embraced the Triple Bottom Line philosophy of People Planet Profit.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.
