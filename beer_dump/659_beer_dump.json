He took Dani and the three kids to meet the owner of the property, Al Walters. Mr. Walters took an immediate liking to the Jones family and allowed Dani and Larry to sell produce from his corner. Being a farmer, he even started growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry's father showed up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.\r\n    Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising \"Brew your own beer\". He was immediately hooked. After convincing Dani that this was a good idea, they met up with a \"brew master\", ordered the equipment, and they were on their way.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:51", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "WtMfgN", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chalfont", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:51", "streetAddress": "237 West Butler Avenue", "postalCode": "18914", "website": "http://www.crabbylarrys.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1990", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "215-822-8788", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 40.2795164, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.2142895, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-03-21 19:06:05", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m6aqF7/upload_OQ2A32-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m6aqF7/upload_OQ2A32-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m6aqF7/upload_OQ2A32-icon.png"}, "id": "m6aqF7", "name": "Crabby Larry's Brewpub Steak & Crab House"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Here, you can sample our beers in an open, relaxed space, then sit back and enjoy a pint or two of your favorite, all while admiring the brewhouse.\r\n\r\nThe Crystal Lake Brewing Co. is a production brewery, and we're totally focused on producing top-\u00adnotch beers. We won\u2019t be serving any food in the tap room, but you'll be welcome to bring it in with you or order delivery from one of the nearby eateries. From time to time, expect to see a food truck parked just outside the front door, where you can grab a casual bite.\r\n\r\nThe tap room will always be pouring our best known beers, but you'll always find \"pilot\" brews, too. These unique beers will be brewed in smaller quantities and will be available only here at the brewery. Something new will always be on tap.\r\n\r\nOf course, brewery tours will be offered, too.\r\n\r\nLook for \"CLB\" beer at your favorite tavern or restaurant this summer, or at a local summertime festival.

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm. Brewery tours are given Saturdays at 2pm.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is currently distributed in:\r\nColorado:\r\nAmerican Eagle Distributing and C.R.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.
