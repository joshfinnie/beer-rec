After briefly leaving his practice to fight in the Civil War, A.B. returned to the practice of law in 1866. Since that time, A.B., his son (Warner Marion), grandson (William Craig), great grandson (Edward Kent), and/or great-great grandson ( Michael) have continuously practiced law in the State of Texas. \r\n\r\n Named after Alfred Brown Peticolas, our English brown ale is a dialed back version of the American interpretation. It\u2019s copper in color with a pleasantly light hop aroma, which is balanced with a delicate roasty maltiness. Notes of nut and chocolate are subdued, but clearly present in flavor. This beer\u2019s body is medium-light and possesses a smooth texture with a hint of residual sweetness. \r\n\r\n The roasted characteristics of this beer make it the perfect match for any meats or vegetables prepared on the grill.\r\n\r\n A little more on A.B. Peticolas? He was born in Richmond, Virginia, on May 27, 1838. As a young man, he studied law and taught school. He began his practice in Virginia, but ultimately moved west to Victoria, Texas. In 1859, he opened up a law practice with Samuel A. White. A.B. Peticolas may be best remembered today for his published Civil War journals and detailed pencil sketches, having served during the Sibley Campaign in New Mexico with Co. C., 4th Regiment, Texas Mounted Volunteers. After his discharge in 1865, he returned to Victoria to practice law. In 1894, A.B. Peticolas authored an index-digest to all civil cases contained in the Texas Report. This catalog became standard text of the Texas Bar Association for years. In his later years, A.B.

After several years of apprenticing with other master brewers, Mark was ready to begin crafting beer using his own recipes.\r\n\r\nHe found the perfect spot in Charlottesville, VA; a historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state of Virginia\u2019s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Mark re-opened the doors and introduced the Starr Hill Brewery. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its historic building with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall, and it was there that Mark's delicious craft beers became a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world. Nineteen prestigious awards later, Mark\u2019s brews continue to be a hit at beer and music festivals nationwide.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, in response to the growing demand, Mark moved from this small brewing operation to a larger brewing facility several miles outside of town, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's core and seasonal brews are now enjoyed in restaurants and music clubs throughout the Mid Atlantic and Southeast, and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores in the region.\r\n\r\nMark is proud of the awards his microbrews have earned, and the experts agree that he is among the best craft brewers in the country.

The first beer brewed was Allagash White, a spiced wheat beer and now our company flagship available in 17 states. We love beer, we love working with each other, we continually push the limits of beer and ourselves, and we grow as a profitable and sustainable company (and as individuals), without compromising our values or purpose. This passion has helped us push Allagash to the forefront of the growing Belgian beer category. We\u2019ve won countless awards for our beer (11 medals including 4 gold since 2002 at The Great American Beer Festival & 10 medals including gold & silver in 2012 since 1998 at the bi-annual World Beer Cup), and received acclaim in the press (Gourmet, Bon Appetit, Men\u2019s Journal, GQ, The Wall Street Journal and Saveur). But perhaps best of all, everyone in the Allagash family loves working here.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  9:30am - 5:30pm\nTue:  9:30am - 5:30pm\nWed:  9:30am - 5:30pm\nThu:  9:30am - 5:30pm\nFri:  9:30am - 5:30pm\n\nMon - Fri: 9:30 am - 5:30 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Portland", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "id": "hP5LHZ", "streetAddress": "50 Industrial Way", "postalCode": "04103", "website": "http://www.allagash.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1995", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "800-330-5385", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 43.703215, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Maine", "longitude": -70.317677, "updateDate": "2014-08-25 19:12:32", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-08-01 14:27:58", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pdLPeS/upload_0Ut2Nj-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pdLPeS/upload_0Ut2Nj-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pdLPeS/upload_0Ut2Nj-icon.png"}, "id": "pdLPeS", "name": "Allagash Brewing Company"}], "description": "Fluxus '09 was brewed in the style of the traditional Saison. For our twist, we added sweet potatoes, black pepper and a generous amount of hops. Sweet potatoes not only enhance its pale orange appearance, they contribute significant body. Centennial hops produce a bold grapefruit aroma, which is followed by a mild, honeysuckle sweetness. The intensity of both the pepper and hops are felt throughout, leaving a lingering warmth on the tongue. Papya, citrus and pepper dominate the flavor profile.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:39", "year": 2009, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.055", "description": "Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "20", "categoryId": 5, "srmMax": "14", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "4.5", "fgMin": "1.004", "fgMax": "1.016", "abvMax": "8.5", "id": 72, "srmMin": "4", "name": "French & Belgian-Style Saison"}, "name": "Allagash Fluxus '09", "servingTemperature": "cool", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "servingTemperatureDisplay": "Cool - (8-12C/45-54F)", "updateDate": "2013-11-26 12:29:04", "abv": "8.3", "styleId": 72, "availableId": 3, "id": "AILnFm", "glasswareId": 5}], "numberOfPages": 683}
