The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "DrFlD0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Carlsbad", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "571 Carlsbad Village Dr.", "postalCode": "92008", "website": "http://www.pizzaport.com/locations/carlsbad/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1997", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "760-720-7007", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Carlsbad", "latitude": 33.1596505, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.3478111, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Sun - Thur - 11am - 10pm\r\nFri - Sat. - 11am - Midnight", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Solana Beach", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "id": "qAyZMR", "streetAddress": "135 N.

After several years of apprenticing with other master brewers, Mark was ready to begin crafting beer using his own recipes.\r\n\r\nHe found the perfect spot in Charlottesville, VA; a historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state of Virginia\u2019s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Mark re-opened the doors and introduced the Starr Hill Brewery. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its historic building with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall, and it was there that Mark's delicious craft beers became a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world. Nineteen prestigious awards later, Mark\u2019s brews continue to be a hit at beer and music festivals nationwide.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, in response to the growing demand, Mark moved from this small brewing operation to a larger brewing facility several miles outside of town, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's core and seasonal brews are now enjoyed in restaurants and music clubs throughout the Mid Atlantic and Southeast, and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores in the region.\r\n\r\nMark is proud of the awards his microbrews have earned, and the experts agree that he is among the best craft brewers in the country.

The subtle complexities of this beer begin with a base of 100% Maris Otter English pale malt \u2013 prized for its superior, rich, bready taste \u2013 which adds a malt complexity that is difficult to achieve with modern, higher yielding malt varieties.  English crystal malt increases the malt complexity, brings amber color and some residual sweetness, all of which mingles well with the fully expressed fruity esters developed by our house ale yeast during fermentation.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.
