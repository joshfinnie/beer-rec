Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "25", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "6.2", "fgMin": "1.016", "fgMax": "1.028", "abvMax": "8", "id": 15, "srmMin": "15", "name": "Scotch Ale"}, "id": "offFqm", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "updateDate": "2014-09-11 16:27:44", "abv": "9.2", "styleId": 15, "availableId": 2, "ibu": "20", "glasswareId": 5}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://crowhopbrewing.com", "established": "2013", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Local Handcrafted Beer in the Heart of Downtown Loveland.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-11-22 17:10:42", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Thu: 3:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri: 3:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 6:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Loveland", "createDate": "2013-11-22 17:11:26", "id": "Nmi5nc", "streetAddress": "217 East 3rd Street", "postalCode": "80537", "website": "http://crowhopbrewing.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(970) 633-0643", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 40.394575, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Colorado", "longitude": -105.074069, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-11-22 17:11:37", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9LBza2/upload_d3o9Bh-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9LBza2/upload_d3o9Bh-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9LBza2/upload_d3o9Bh-icon.png"}, "id": "9LBza2", "name": "Crow Hop Brewing Co"}], "updateDate": "2014-09-11 16:28:00", "description": "American Lager blended with a bit of Czech pils style.

Owner/Brewers Nick Anderson and Dan Chang started the company in 2004 with the help of a third partner, Robbie Stair after relocating to Minneapolis from Seattle. Robbie owned a farm in scenic Maiden Rock, WI just above the confluence of the Rush River and Lake Pepin. After converting a pole barn into a fully functioning brewery, the trio produced a limited quantity of draft-only beers while steadily building a reputation  for brewing high quality ales. After two and a half years of growth, it became evident that bottled beer was the next move to be made. Luckily, the town of River Falls, WI came to the table with an offer to build a custom building for a brand new brewery. In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters. The new Rush River brewery was now poised to increase production and distributorship. We now have ten distributors in two states and produce nine brands including seasonals.
