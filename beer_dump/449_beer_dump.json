Choosing organic production is also in keeping with the spirit of our home town of Nelson, a laid-back, progressive community nestled in the heart of the Kootenays. With limitless backcountry skiing and hiking at our back door, as well as a host of other outdoor activities year-round, brewing an organic beer in Nelson just seems like the natural thing to do.\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to be organic? Organic certification is a guarantee that our beer and its ingredients were produced without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or genetic engineering. Our processes, cleaning and sanitation regimes must also adhere to a strict set of organic principles and be approved by our organic certification body. Being organic also signifies a commitment to environmental sustainability. Our goal is to eventually source all of our ingredients as locally as possible.
