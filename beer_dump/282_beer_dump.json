What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

The microbrewery is located in a 7,000-square-foot (650 m2) factory in in Red Hook, Brooklyn that formerly manufactured filing cabinets. Sixpoint began business by only distributing kegs to local bars and restaurants; instead of bottling its beer, filling growlers at bars were the only way for customers to drink the beer at their homes. \r\n\r\nIn 2011 Sixpoint launched initial canned  offerings of 16 oz, year-round styles Sweet Action, Bengali Tiger, Righteous Ale and The Crisp.  Further releases have included the 12 oz Resin and 3Beans, as well as 16oz seasonal offerings such as Apollo and Autumnation.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "mailingListUrl": "http://sixpoint.com/connect", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "QJRQhZ", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Brooklyn", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "streetAddress": "40 Van Dyke St", "postalCode": "11231", "website": "http://www.sixpointcraftales.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2005", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "917-696-0438", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 40.6739317, "locationType": "micro", "region": "New York", "longitude": -74.0119473, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-08-09 16:33:25", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7VPQrN/upload_X4w8Lq-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7VPQrN/upload_X4w8Lq-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7VPQrN/upload_X4w8Lq-icon.png"}, "id": "7VPQrN", "name": "Sixpoint Brewery"}], "description": "We crafted HI-RES as a testament to ceaseless, intrepid human nature.
