Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm. Brewery tours are given Saturdays at 2pm.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is currently distributed in:\r\nColorado:\r\nAmerican Eagle Distributing and C.R.

The color reflects the choice of fruit. Sourness is an important part of the flavor profile, though sweetness may compromise the intensity. These flavored lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet and range from a dry to a full-bodied mouthfeel. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.

Three years into our project and we\u2019re grateful and amazed that so many people love and support great beer these days.  The fact that we\u2019re still here is a credit to you all.\r\n\r\nBut for the question of primary importance: What is the beer? Well, it\u2019s our Pretty Things barleywine.  Inspired by malted barley, a tribute to the barleycorn.  Yes, it\u2019s simple, but that\u2019s what barleywines are all about.  Ever since brewing in England, Dann has dreamed of making a barley-focused beer using the malts of Yorkshire (and never hesitates to plug his favorite: Thomas Fawcett & Sons).  The American version of a barleywine is normally a sad beer indeed, lots of hops and alcohol but the star of the show is left scratching his chin in the eaves of the theatre.  This is not one of those beers.  The English invented this style and they\u2019re the only ones who know how to make one, save the rare American brewer.\r\n\r\nGive barley a chance and this mysterious little grain can do grand things!\r\n\r\nTo get the density of sugars needed for this sort of beer, we employed \u201cdouble mashing\u201d. The brewhouse that we work on can only get to maybe 18 plato for a single running of wort: but we wanted 27 plato! So we combined two brews by running wort into the kettle and then using it to mash in the second batch. We don\u2019t take credit for this idea.  We\u2019re certain it has been done many, many times before.  But it wasn\u2019t until Will Meyers (the great Cantabridgian Cervecero) brought this method to our attention that we realized we could brew a barleywine of proper gravity\u2026 (he never told us that he hadn\u2019t actually performed this sort of brewing before!). Anyway, it works!!\r\n\r\nExpect an aroma of juicy sultanas, wet wood, green apple, malted milk balls, marzipan and alcohol deliciousness. It\u2019s got a medium body and is a little more spritsy than we\u2019re sure the Brits would like. Serve over 50 degrees fahrenheit in a stemmed glass.\r\n\r\nVery suitable to drink this year or next, or even the winter after that!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-04-23 19:25:19", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LMPeqi/upload_XWCgO7-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LMPeqi/upload_XWCgO7-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LMPeqi/upload_XWCgO7-icon.png"}, "originalGravity": "1.116", "name": "Our Finest Regards", "servingTemperature": "cool", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 10, "name": "Oversized Wine Glass"}, "servingTemperatureDisplay": "Cool - (8-12C/45-54F)", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.09", "description": "American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness.
