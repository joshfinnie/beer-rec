In the beginning we had only one ale, the Guldenberg, named after the Guldenberg Abbey in Wevelgem, where beer was brewed in the past. With a history in the beer world (since 1930 the Bacelle - Noffels family was active in beer commerce and as a lemonade producer), Nino had started experimenting with brewing ale in 1981. After an education as brewer at the CTL in Ghent in the mid eighties, he kept experimenting and in the nineties he thought his time had come (and his ale was good enough) to commercialize his ale. After a decent study of the possibilities to start his own brewery, he decided to start with brewing in a existing brewery. The good thing about this formula is that it\u2019s possible to brew profitable without big investments. The Deca brewery is Woesten was chosen to do this and in the first year 9000 litres of Guldenberg were brewed.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "qBSM79", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Wevelgem", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "streetAddress": "Brugsstraat 43", "latitude": 50.8104527, "website": "http://deranke.be/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1994", "countryIsoCode": "BE", "phone": "32-056-41-82-41", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "West-Vlaanderen", "longitude": 3.1857196, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Belgium", "name": "BELGIUM", "isoThree": "BEL", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 56, "isoCode": "BE"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-03-21 19:06:04", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/C7C49d/upload_ZTLrqN-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/C7C49d/upload_ZTLrqN-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/C7C49d/upload_ZTLrqN-icon.png"}, "id": "C7C49d", "name": "Brouwerij De Ranke"}], "updateDate": "2012-03-22 13:04:30", "abv": "7", "id": "L2dAEr", "name": "Kriek"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:34", "breweries": [{"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:03", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "CA", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Brampton", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Ontario", "longitude": -79.7152007, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "905-374-1166", "streetAddress": "54 Bramsteele Road", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:03", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Canada", "name": "CANADA", "isoThree": "CAN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 124, "isoCode": "CA"}, "postalCode": "L6W 3M6", "latitude": 43.6868555, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "d4x5jt", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "name": "Niagara Falls Brewing Company", "updateDate": "2012-03-21 19:06:08", "id": "e77inA", "description": "Niagara Falls Brewing Company has been bought by Moosehead, and moved to Brampton, Ontario in 2007.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

After a decent study of the possibilities to start his own brewery, he decided to start with brewing in a existing brewery.

These flavored lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet and range from a dry to a full-bodied mouthfeel. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.  Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "15", "categoryId": 5, "ibuMax": "21", "abvMin": "5.6", "fgMin": "1.008", "fgMax": "1.016", "abvMax": "8.6", "id": 68, "name": "Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic"}, "updateDate": "2014-09-15 14:30:03", "abv": "5", "styleId": 68, "id": "6oEP92", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://madfoxbrewing.com/", "established": "2010", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Mad Fox Brewing Company offers a dining experience unique to the Washington, DC, area: upscale casual dining in an English-style gastro brewpub with an emphasis on high-quality food to complement our house-brewed beers.\r\n\r\nMad Fox features a chef-driven, seasonal menu and frequent specials including pizza, panini, salads and vegetarian friendly foods; fresh, locally grown seasonal produce, cheeses and other ingredients; locally raised lamb, bison, beef, chicken and game; and house-cured meats.\r\n\r\nMad Fox has a 63-foot long bar showcasing our seven to ten standard, house-brewed beers on tap as well as a rotating selection of seasonal brews in German, English, Belgian and American styles.

This \"winter warmer\" highlights the rich, toasty, aromatic and chocolaty malt flavors as its very sturdy foundation. Generous amounts of four different hop varieties were added in five different additions that delivers a magnificent and massive hop assault. There's still some ginger and cinnamon added into the batch but the spices are a little more subdued than in years' past.

It is not called the \u201cbeer factory\u201d or the \u201cbrewery\u201d, but \u201cFORST\u201d. The name is inherently linked with the local area. It stands for tradition and love for nature, but also striving to ensure that the quality of its products remains consistently high.
