Soon the secret was out and Winterfest quickly became a cColorado holiday favorite.  Twenty-four years alter, Winterfest is still a labor of love.\r\n\r\nWe began brewing Winterfest exclusively for our friends in Colorado during September in anticipation of the holiday season.  We brewed a limited quantity to ensure the highest quality and freshness, which is represented by a unique \"limited edition\" number on each bottle.\r\n\r\nTo develop the distinctive characteristics of this outstanding winter lager, we combined our prized Moravian two-row barley malt with choice hops from the Hallertau region of Germany.  After brewing, we chill-lagered Winterfest at 1\u00b0 Celsius, to produce a perfectly balanced seasonal lager with an exceptionally crisp, clean finish.\r\n\r\nWe recommend you pour Winterfest into a glass, creating a two-inch head in order to fully appreciate its complex bouquet and flavor.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of seasonal beers to choose from, but there's only one that's become a true holiday tradition in Colorado.

It would take 21 years for that initial interest to manifest itself into something drinkable. The spark would come after 9/11 while he drank homebrewed stout with five of his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company. Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to create their first signature brews.\r\n\r\nThey decided to locate the brewery at the beautiful \u201cTwin Lakes Farm\u201d in Greenville, Delaware. This historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam\u2019s family for seven generations and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing. Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13, 2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were launched. \r\n\r\nToday Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed\u2019s Tavern Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious.
