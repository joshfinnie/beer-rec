Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.
