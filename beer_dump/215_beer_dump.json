For us, this includes being environmentally conscious. We have laced filters in our drains for run-off water, so we can use that water to irrigate our lawns and plants. We also plan to purchase solar panels for our brewery. We recycle, and you will quickly learn that after visiting our beautiful tasting room. Check out our bar, you will see what we mean.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of doing the right thing is through charitable donations. We have been truly blessed in life and want to give to those who are in need of a blessing. A portion of our Yellow Armadillo Wheat sales will go to a local cancer research/support foundation, and a portion of our Thirsty Goat Amber sales will go to help purchase farm animals (maybe goats?) for needy people in third world countries.

The idea spread as friends tasted the unique beers, and the popularity of those early batches encouraged a dedicated team of three partners to begin working to make the dream of a local brewery a reality. Mark Seibold, JD Merryweather and Daniel Mercer spent the next two years traveling throughout the United States, Europe and Central America visiting breweries and sampling local flavors. The insight gained from entrepreneurs, brewers, biologists, operations personnel and consumers provided an invaluable basis for a serious endeavor into quality commercial brewing. By integrating this knowledge with the local, regional and national brewing trends, as well as local feedback, the trio planned the birth and growth of the yet unnamed COOP. After nearly 3 years of research, comprising thousands of man hours and dozens of test batches, COOP fashioned its identity as a steadfast professional team that holds closely a passion for bringing quality, local beer to taps and homes in Oklahoma City and beyond.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith the help of close friends and fellow craft-beer fans, COOP was capitalized on July 15th, 2008. In less than 6 months, the COOP team; navigated the multi-layered regulatory process, secured a building lease, completed the remodel, purchased and installed a commercial brewery, obtained brewing licenses from the State of Oklahoma and the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, created and branded original recipe beers and brewed the first full scale batches for distribution.\r\n\r\nThe outpouring of support that has come from friends of the COOP team has been overwhelming. Our sincere hope is that you \u2013 the fan of COOP Ale Works \u2013 will take pride in the beers, as if they were your own.
