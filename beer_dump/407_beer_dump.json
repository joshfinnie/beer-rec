Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Sunday - Thursday: 12-8\r\nFriday and Saturday: 12-10", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Sawyer", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "id": "AlhRYb", "streetAddress": "5885 Sawyer Rd.", "postalCode": "49125", "website": "http://www.greenbushbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "269-405-1076", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.8856286, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -86.5946671, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "updateDate": "2012-04-09 18:18:49", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QJRQhZ/upload_999gvA-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QJRQhZ/upload_999gvA-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QJRQhZ/upload_999gvA-icon.png"}, "id": "QJRQhZ", "name": "Greenbush Brewing Co"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.055", "description": "Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer.

We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally.

While large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next.  At Brevard Brewing Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds \u2013 beer that is both drinkable and flavorful.  We are the only brewery in Western North Carolina to specialize in lagers. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the big deal about lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales.  They are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world.  But the result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor of ales.  The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable.\r\n\r\nWhile German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over the past thirty years.  I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner, but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA.  This is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German lagers.
