Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal.

This is our fourth barrel aged release and each year is another adventure into the flavor unknown.  Our oak aging cellar continues to grow and so do the blending possibilities.  We peaked at just over 120 barrels in our program this year, yet only 53 barrels made this year\u2019s final blend.  We have stayed true to our original goal of making straight ahead strong ales and letting them rest in wood barrels to mature and develop flavors slowly and naturally.  We again met with some of the area\u2019s best wine makers and allowed them to guide us to the finished product.  Most of the beers that are in this blend are old friends who we know well.  Dark and ominous Parabola along with the rich and complex Bravo Brown were brewed again this year and together became the center piece of this blend.  Other beers like the Rufus and Opal along with Sean Paxton\u2019s Saucerful of Secrets are still tucked away in the cellar in their original first generation form, gaining character with extended aging.   Velvet Merkin has established itself as a real barrel loving beer, although it is only 6%, it carries barrel qualities beautifully.  A new beer, that was created this year by our Cellar Master Ali Razi, is Double Double Barrel Ale and it found its way into this blend as well.  In the end, this year brought us seven wine makers and seven beers to counter balance our lucky thirteenth year of brewing beer on the Central Coast.
