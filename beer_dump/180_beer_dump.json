The story goes, Wesley was approached by his father, Tim, one day about what he was going to do with his life. As an ocean lifeguard and co-owner of a bar, Wesley thought he had it made. His dad informed him of a trademark he had won in 2004 and subsequently protected in contest from Anheuser Busch. The name was TailGate Beer.\r\n\r\nTim thought TailGate Beer was something special. As an avid sports fan and tailgater, Tim implored Wesley to take his homebrews that people loved drinking and brew TailGate Beer! Wesley, having put himself through college at San Diego State University, grew up modestly. The gift of TailGate Beer was a generous one but, unlike some tales of entrepreneurism, didn\u2019t come with startup funds.\r\n\r\nThey both agreed the name was solid and the marketing would one day be fun, but Wesley was emphatic that the beer had to be excellent. From there, Wesley took what he liked to brew, and brewed in Southern California. All initial beers were brewed and packaged in kegs and glass bottles. Wesley entered into the Great American Beer Festival in 2007 and although no formal awards were won, TailGate Beer was a hit! This drew lots of attention from beer fans from all over the country. The common response was \u201cgreat beer!\u201d and \u201cgreat name!\u201d So with confirmation of Wesley\u2019s biggest apprehension \u2013 people loved the beer \u2013 TailGate Beer was born.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:09", "mailingListUrl": "http://tailgatebeer.com/tailgate-newsletter/", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.tailgatebeer.com", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "TailGate Beer", "locality": "San Diego", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "countryIsoCode": "US", "longitude": -117.1572551, "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "858-215-4842", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:09", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2007", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "latitude": 32.7153292, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "XqWTM7", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-08-16 01:31:05", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-icon.png"}, "id": "PuOZUW", "name": "TailGate Beer"}], "name": "Dodgy Knight", "createDate": "2013-04-17 13:10:09", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Bdp8AC/upload_hvHolr-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Bdp8AC/upload_hvHolr-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Bdp8AC/upload_hvHolr-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.075", "description": "Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

They also take time to push the limits of brewing with the \"Brick Mason\" series, which the staff sees as their continuing masterpiece. Highlights from this series include \"The Lost Years\" old ale, \"Black-Eye Rye\" American black ale, and the most recent release \"20th Anniversary\", a 10% Imperial stout that was aged in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels. Early accolades have already compared it to the hallowed KBS.\r\n\r\nThe future keeps looking brighter and brighter for this brewery, and the next couple years will see them growing and experimenting with diverse styles, collaborating with fellow breweries, implementing a new barrel program, and continuing to raise the bar for themselves in all aspects.

After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. In 2011, the Ebel brothers purchased Walter Payton's Roundhouse located in Aurora, IL.
