After Frederic\u2019s passing, his widow Emma owned the business in entirety and it was shortly prior to her death that she instigated the formation of Frederic Robinson Limited. 4th generation Robinsons, Frederic, John and Cecil joined the board and continued to build the company alongside their father William.\r\n\r\nWith bottling commencing from a new building in 1908, new offices in 1913 and a new brewhouse in 1929, by William\u2019s death in 1933, despite the countries difficult economic climate, Robinsons was strongly positioned for further growth. Over the following years, the estate grew by acquisition, new buildings and extending the geographical area. The first Welsh house \u2013 The Black Lion was bought in 1943. William Robinson, would have been proud to hear John, his great grandchild, was honoured with a knighthood in 1958 for political and public services in Cheshire- 120 years after William purchased the Unicorn Inn.

Robinsons\u2019 bottled ales such as Old Tom and Unicorn are distributed worldwide. The sixth generation strive to build further upon the family legacy. Neil, Veronica, Paul, Oliver and William were elected to the board in September 2003, followed three years later by Sara, who is now Company Secretary and John in May 2009.\r\n\r\nOur eyes are firmly on the future as we develop brewery, brands and pubs at pace.

David's passion would continue to grow and evolve.  He learned the tradition of brewing in America.  The history of small family owned breweries that we able to serve fresh handcrafted beer to their local communities.  The fact that the these small local breweries became points of pride in the community and that the businesses would stay in the family for generations.  \r\n \r\nAn idea began to grow.  The idea that despite the brewing world we live in now with mega breweries pumping out mass marketed bland beer, that a small locally owned brewery making fresh unique beer could again be a source of pride for a community.  David dreamed of recreating this American brewing tradition and so set out on his way to do just that.\r\n \r\nDavid spent the next 7 years honing his craft.  Learning about beer styles and brewing techniques.  Winning contests with his beer and defining a unique style for quality and consistency.  In 2012 the wheels were set into motion for our brewery when David met Tyler Meusburger, a colleague with a passion for entrepreneurship and creativity.  Working together they began building a business plan and putting financing into place, and in Nov of 2013 David and Tyler brewed the first batch of beer at New American Brewing Co.\r\n \r\nWe look forward to continuing our story and living a \"New Tradition\" of American brewing.\r\n \r\nDrink American!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-07-25 14:17:39", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "ZK7bhN", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Ankeny", "createDate": "2014-07-25 14:20:32", "streetAddress": "1460 NE 69th Pl Suite 67", "postalCode": "50021", "website": "http://www.newamericanbeer.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "515-250-8703", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.6863399, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Iowa", "longitude": -93.5994046, "updateDate": "2014-07-25 14:20:32", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "updateDate": "2014-07-25 14:17:40", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RHn3Pm/upload_kNLdvb-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RHn3Pm/upload_kNLdvb-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RHn3Pm/upload_kNLdvb-icon.png"}, "id": "RHn3Pm", "name": "New American Brewing Co."}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.075", "description": "Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Because it will be brewed in such small batches, much of the beer will be available only for purchase in the Bike Dog tasting room \u2014 allowing customers to see the beer go from grain to glass and hobnob with the brewers and allowing the brewers to personally nurture the local craft beer community.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-12-31 20:04:43", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Fri: 5:00 pm - 9:30 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 9:30 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "West Sacramento", "createDate": "2014-01-01 03:30:56", "id": "KdoYYr", "streetAddress": "2534 Industrial Boulevard", "postalCode": "95691", "extendedAddress": "#110", "website": "http://www.bikedogbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2013", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(916) 432-3376", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 38.566263, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -121.543518, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-01-01 03:31:07", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iW1GUi/upload_pqYKKU-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iW1GUi/upload_pqYKKU-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iW1GUi/upload_pqYKKU-icon.png"}, "id": "iW1GUi", "name": "Bike Dog Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.075", "description": "Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale.
