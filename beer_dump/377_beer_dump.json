At least one regional combination of ingredients and/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager. Entries not accompanied by this information will be at a profound disadvantage during judging.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "id": 128, "name": "Indigenous Beer (Lager or Ale)"}, "updateDate": "2012-08-28 12:59:42", "styleId": 128, "availableId": 2, "id": "CZ54Vi", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Limited availability.", "id": 2, "name": "Limited"}, "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Mad Scientists Series #5: Shiso Beer", "createDate": "2012-08-27 17:25:05", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.sixpoint.com/", "established": "2004", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Sixpoint Craft Ales was founded in 2004 by Shane Welch, a former homebrewer that originally grew up in Milwaukee.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "S2n5TB", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chicago", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "streetAddress": "1800 West Fulton Street", "postalCode": "60612", "website": "http://www.gooseisland.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1995", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-800-466-7363", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.887107, "locationType": "production", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.6720969, "updateDate": "2014-09-11 10:33:51", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "D2gG2C", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chicago", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "1800 North Clybourn Avenue", "postalCode": "60614", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1988", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "800-466-7363", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Clybourn", "latitude": 41.9137242, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.65373, "updateDate": "2014-09-11 10:32:55", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-09-11 10:16:07", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_w0f4W1-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_w0f4W1-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_w0f4W1-icon.png"}, "id": "APW1BC", "name": "Goose Island Beer Company"}], "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:39", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/TAR2y5/upload_bSH21P-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/TAR2y5/upload_bSH21P-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/TAR2y5/upload_bSH21P-icon.png"}, "updateDate": "2012-03-22 13:05:40", "id": "TAR2y5", "name": "Mae"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Maea Ipaea", "createDate": "2014-09-05 20:12:24", "breweries": [{"website": "http://saugatuckbrewing.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Saugatuck Brewing Co. is a traditional Irish style pub that features quality beer, wine, food, and service.

Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a \u201cContract Brewing\u201d or \u201cBeer Marketing\u201d company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery.\r\n\r\nThe Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words \"Skull Coast\" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company.

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.

After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.

And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.
