A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.

Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process\u2026.but it was flat worth every bit of it all.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery\r\nWe brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties).

We package our beer in self-pressurizing mini-kegs that hold the equivalent of a case of beer, half\u2013gallon refillable growler bottles and 1/6 barrel (5 gallon) kegs that can be used in commercial and home draft systems. Some of our specialty beers, like our Cherry Ale, will only be available in limited quantities.\r\nWe are a production brewery that sells beer right from the premises. Although we don\u2019t currently have a tasting room where we can sell beer by the glass \u2013 we will be offering samples to help you decide which beer to purchase.\r\n\r\nWe are open to the public Wednesday-Friday 2pm to 7pm, Saturday 12 (noon) to 7pm and Sunday 12 (noon) to 4pm. You can purchase our beers outside of the brewery at The Pour House in Aurora, Indiana, Bakers Discount Liquors in Rising Sun, Indiana and Whitey\u2019s in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. We are also available on draft at Bourbons Bar & Grill in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Friday 1PM to 6PM\r\nSaturday Noon to 6PM\r\nClosed Sunday through Thursday", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Aurora", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "id": "Hg8V7d", "streetAddress": "315 Importing Street", "postalCode": "47001", "website": "http://www.gcbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2008", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "812-655-9079", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.057436, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -84.8996633, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-10-23 15:11:09", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DZbNSQ/upload_vZusaG-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DZbNSQ/upload_vZusaG-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DZbNSQ/upload_vZusaG-icon.png"}, "id": "DZbNSQ", "name": "Great Crescent Brewery"}], "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-03-30 12:01:54", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/wNz3zT/upload_L9Qoxb-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/wNz3zT/upload_L9Qoxb-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/wNz3zT/upload_L9Qoxb-icon.png"}, "updateDate": "2012-03-30 12:01:55", "id": "wNz3zT", "name": "Felsen Aged Lager"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-08-12 12:13:23", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.dab.de", "established": "1875", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Dortmunder Actien Brauerei", "createDate": "2012-08-07 10:18:46", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "DE", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Dortmund", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Nordrhein-Westfalen", "longitude": 7.46402, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 51.52641, "streetAddress": "Steigerstra\u00dfe 20", "createDate": "2012-08-12 14:47:24", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Germany", "name": "GERMANY", "isoThree": "DEU", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 276, "isoCode": "DE"}, "postalCode": "D-44145", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "j7TQXl", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-09-21 14:47:22", "id": "QiUHuc", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "updateDate": "2012-08-16 23:19:46", "id": "dB8STH", "name": "Felskrone Alt"}], "numberOfPages": 683}
