But he also has a little-known passion for wine-making. In 1995, while he was crushing grapes and thinking back to his travels through California and French wine country, the idea of blending a beer with a wine popped into his head. Intrigued, he had to give it a shot.\r\n\r\nHe started by using the juice of Chardonnay grapes to give the beer a crisp, light quality, very much like a glass of Chardonnay. He then used white wheat as the only grain to create a clean, smooth finish that could not be achieved with other malts. After cellar-aging the batch for a couple of months, he tasted his latest work. He was pleasantly surprised with the clarity and refreshing taste.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, with wine and Craft beer growing in popularity with drinkers, he decided it would be a good time to bring it back. After a couple of years at festivals and special events, it started to gain a following. Then in 2010, it just happened to take home a gold medal from the Great American Beer Festival\u00ae.

Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels.

Pilsners are lager beers, meaning they are brewed with bottom fermenting yeast, and then aged or lagered in cold conditioning tanks.\r\n\r\nSince their introduction, pilsners have become the most popular style of beer in the world. At Uinta, we have replicated a true old world pilsner by using the finest imported Saaz hops and then aging this golden lager for nearly a month. The aging process creates a smooth, mellow flavor that gives it a remarkable drinkability. Enjoy the delicate balance between the flowery hops and the assertive malt flavors.\r\n\r\nWhere did the name come from? Uinta embraced the concept of renewable energy in 2001 by committing to 100% wind powered energy. The name Blue Sky Pilsner stems from that commitment.\r\n\r\nTASTING NOTES:\r\nMalty taste and generously hopped. Citrus highlights. Finishes crisp and dry. Blue Sky pairs well with spicy food, and dishes such as chicken satay and grilled sausages.
