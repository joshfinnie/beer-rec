In 1986, Teo decides, with his partner then Michelle, a pretty young French dancer, to open in Piozzo, a small town unknown to the door of the Langhe where he was born, a \"creperie\"! He rents a former \"tavern\" with an attached mini apartment on the top floor and a gravel courtyard on the back and opens its doors. At first, his passion for beer, and a little 'light his aversion for wine led him to fill the menu with more than two hundred references international beers, as well as dainties to enjoy to work alongside the crepes. Gradually, the goodness of the choices made \u200b\u200bgood name and port customers to small local baptized \"Le Baladin\" by his friend Fran\u00e7ois of CIRQUE BIDON in homage to the nature of Teo same. Years went by and the room expands, you change, you will see a big circus tent to cover the courtyard paved with gravel now tables and chairs in style \"Oktoberfest\" and hand in hand also changes his mentor: Nora is now its new companion and muse together and decide a new course of the local : transform the creperie in a brewpub! After months of study and travel with Nora to discover Belgian brewers have our hero returns with huge bins loaded onto a van Volkswagen Westfalia and places them in the garage of the ousted former owner of the house, adjacent to the restaurant, now transformed into a microbrewery. So begins the adventure productive BEER BALADIN that sees just two beers \"taxes\" to the regulars who frequent the pub goers somewhat perplexed and embarrassed to taste these first, honestly a bit 'adventurous productions Teo. Over time, the production will be moved to other places for sizing issues and logistics, but still the aura of magic that permeated the early days of the brewery remains unchanged. Today, large kitchen has taken the place of the production and in the pub beers are on tap now classic carnet baladiniano as well as all production in the bottle. Occasionally a few small tweaks gives customers reason of surprise and veiled \"Amarcord\" in which one of them remembers the beginnings of this place, now a destination for \"pilgrimage\" by many fans of the beer world. It is always a place where good food is accompanied not only by our beers but by good music and by the sympathy of the staff who always has a smile for everyone and where it is customary to a friendly \"welcome\", a hello and a good day to all those who pass through it if only for a small beer refreshing.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "IT", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Piozzo", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "longitude": 7.8921316, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "39-0173-795431", "streetAddress": "Piazza V Luglio, 15", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Italy", "name": "ITALY", "isoThree": "ITA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 380, "isoCode": "IT"}, "latitude": 44.5154291, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "1kXTo5", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2013-06-18 12:59:18", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6iVXTk/upload_AySF0L-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6iVXTk/upload_AySF0L-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6iVXTk/upload_AySF0L-icon.png"}, "id": "6iVXTk", "name": "Birrificia Le Baladin"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.058", "description": "Dark amber to brown in color, old ales are medium to full bodied with a malty sweetness.

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style.
