My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality. Thank you to all those who have helped me get here.\r\n\r\n- Grant Pauly, 3 Sheeps Brewing", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-03-08 20:04:30", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "5R4Akp", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "Y", "locality": "Sheboygan", "createDate": "2012-03-08 20:05:17", "streetAddress": "1327 North 14th Street", "postalCode": "53081", "website": "http://www.3sheepsbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "920-395-3583", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 43.7590398, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -87.7229469, "updateDate": "2014-10-06 15:44:18", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-10-09 21:21:27", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hw7H52/upload_c8CRE6-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hw7H52/upload_c8CRE6-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hw7H52/upload_c8CRE6-icon.png"}, "id": "Hw7H52", "name": "3 Sheeps Brewing Company"}], "name": "Ewephoria", "createDate": "2013-11-27 12:31:38", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/6ZAdJp/upload_OlD4RQ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/6ZAdJp/upload_OlD4RQ-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/6ZAdJp/upload_OlD4RQ-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.05", "description": "Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "20", "categoryId": 5, "srmMax": "14", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "4.5", "fgMin": "1.004", "fgMax": "1.016", "abvMax": "8.5", "id": 72, "srmMin": "4", "name": "French & Belgian-Style Saison"}, "name": "Existent", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "updateDate": "2012-08-23 01:56:28", "abv": "7.4", "styleId": 72, "id": "3WyowO", "glasswareId": 5}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Limited availability.", "id": 2, "name": "Limited"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.stillwaterales.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "\"A sincere artist is not one who makes a faithful attempt to put on to canvas what is in front of him, but one who tries to create something which is, in itself, a living thing.\" -Sir William Dobell\r\n\r\nThe goal of Stillwater Artisanal is just that, living art.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.
