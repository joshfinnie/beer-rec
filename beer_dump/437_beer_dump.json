He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market.

They have medium body and range from dry to sweet maltiness with very little hop flavor or aroma. Roast malt tones may sometimes contribute to the flavor and aroma profile. Low to medium-low levels of fruity-ester flavors are appropriate. Diacetyl should be very low, if evident. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "15", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "25", "ibuMax": "25", "abvMin": "4", "fgMin": "1.008", "fgMax": "1.014", "abvMax": "5.5", "id": 12, "srmMin": "13", "name": "English-Style Brown Ale"}, "id": "Rhkul1", "updateDate": "2014-09-24 13:44:23", "abv": "7.8", "styleId": 12, "ibu": "75", "name": "Old Silenus Ale"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:51", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.pearlstreetbrewery.com/brewin/", "established": "1999", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Our brewery started with a dream and a 1984 Eagle Wagon and trailer packed with brewery equipment driven here from Colorado by an ambitious young brewer and his Dad. After a long and tumultuous journey involving disaster and triumph;  joy and heartache ~  they began to build. Following fourteen months of design, building and construction they finally fired up the brew kettle for the first time in December of 1999. Although the brewery was tiny and tucked in a basement on Pearl Street, the celebration and Grand Opening was enough to attract throngs of flavor starved people and get Mayor Medinger to tap the inaugural keg.\r\n\r\nWe have come a long way since. Today we brew, bottle and keg our beers from our new home in the historic La Crosse Footwear building with our expanded 30 barrel brewery. The new brewery has over six times the brewing capacity of the old Pearl Street Brewhouse. And while we spent the first 8 years slinging brews out to nearby pubs and restaurants in draught kegs only, in July of 2007, we unveiled bottled beer in six packs and cases.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:05", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Tue - Fri: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 5:00 am", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "La Crosse", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:05", "id": "Y6z24E", "streetAddress": "1401 Saint Andrew Street", "postalCode": "54603", "website": "http://www.pearlstreetbrewery.com/brewin/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1999", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "608-784-4832", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 43.834352, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -91.236154, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2012-04-11 12:26:08", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LWD44j/upload_eTeauY-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LWD44j/upload_eTeauY-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LWD44j/upload_eTeauY-icon.png"}, "id": "LWD44j", "name": "Pearl Street Brewery"}], "updateDate": "2012-03-22 13:04:40", "id": "mOFDzh", "name": "Old Skeezer Barley Wine"}], "numberOfPages": 683}
