When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.  All of us here at Dick\u2019s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Fridays 3pm - 7pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Centralia", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "id": "TkT8Rc", "streetAddress": "5945 Prather Road", "postalCode": "98531", "website": "http://dicksbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "800-586-7760", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 46.771347, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Washington", "longitude": -123.007543, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-01-28 20:24:58", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_vNkqm1-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_vNkqm1-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_vNkqm1-icon.png"}, "id": "GC3a1f", "name": "Dick's Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Let\u2019s start a craft beer brewery!\u201d  That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality.  They quit their day jobs.  \r\n\r\nWith that leap of faith \u2013 and a ton of support from many friends and family \u2013 they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer \u2013 AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "DF5YsC", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Boston", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "streetAddress": "30 Germania Street", "postalCode": "02130", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-800-372-1131", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.314449, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Massachusetts", "longitude": -71.103365, "updateDate": "2014-09-26 13:04:52", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "MLUbXI", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2013-08-12 13:10:57", "streetAddress": "1625 Central Parkway", "postalCode": "45214", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-412-3200", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Cincinnati", "latitude": 39.1144986, "locationType": "production", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5222061, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-08-03 14:19:13", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_jea6Pe-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_jea6Pe-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_jea6Pe-icon.png"}, "id": "1wSztN", "name": "Boston Beer Company"}], "name": "Simcoe IPA", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-01-22 14:16:53", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vQnyd7/upload_iMpVOo-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vQnyd7/upload_iMpVOo-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vQnyd7/upload_iMpVOo-icon.png"}, "beerVariation": {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "updateDate": "2014-01-14 15:34:34", "description": "Samuel Adams\u00ae Latitude 48 IPA is a unique IPA brewed with a select blend of hops from top German, English, and American growing regions all located close to the 48th latitude within the \u201chop belt\u201d of the Northern Hemisphere.
